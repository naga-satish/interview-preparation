## Architecture & Core Concepts

### 1. What is Snowflake and what are its essential features?
   - Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse platform offering complete separation of compute and storage. Essential features: multi-cluster shared data architecture, automatic scaling, zero-copy cloning, time travel, secure data sharing, support for structured and semi-structured data, ACID compliance, and pay-per-use pricing.

### 2. Explain Snowflake's three-layer architecture (Database Storage, Query Processing, Cloud Services)
   - **Database Storage**: Optimized columnar storage with automatic compression and micro-partitioning. Data stored in cloud blob storage (S3/Azure/GCS).
   - **Query Processing**: Virtual warehouses (compute clusters) that execute queries independently without sharing resources.
   - **Cloud Services**: Manages authentication, metadata, query optimization, transaction management, and infrastructure orchestration.

### 3. How does Snowflake differ from traditional data warehouses?
   - Separates compute from storage (scale independently), cloud-native with no infrastructure management, automatic optimization and maintenance, elastic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, built-in data sharing, and supports semi-structured data natively without transformation.

### 4. What is the difference between shared-disk and shared-nothing architectures, and how does Snowflake use both?
   - **Shared-disk**: Multiple compute nodes access same storage (risk of contention).
   - **Shared-nothing**: Each node has independent storage (difficult scaling). Snowflake combines both: shared storage layer accessible by all warehouses (shared-disk) with independent compute clusters (shared-nothing) for parallel processing without contention.

### 5. How does Snowflake separate compute and storage?
   - Storage layer persists data in cloud object storage, charged by compressed data volume. Compute layer uses virtual warehouses for query processing, charged by usage time. This allows independent scaling: add compute for performance without increasing storage costs, or store more data without affecting compute expenses.

### 6. What are micro-partitions and how do they work?
   - Snowflake automatically divides tables into immutable, compressed micro-partitions (50-500 MB uncompressed). Each contains 16 MB of compressed data on average. Metadata tracks min/max values, null counts, and distinct values per column, enabling efficient query pruning without scanning data.

### 7. Explain Snowflake's columnar storage format
   - Data stored in columns rather than rows, optimizing analytical queries that read specific columns. Benefits: better compression (similar data types together), faster aggregations, reduced I/O (read only needed columns), and efficient for OLAP workloads. Combined with micro-partitioning for optimal performance.

### 8. What is the significance of Snowflake being cloud-native?
   - Built specifically for cloud infrastructure, leveraging elastic compute, object storage scalability, high availability zones, and auto-scaling. No on-premise version exists. Benefits: instant provisioning, unlimited storage, automatic updates, global replication, and consumption-based pricing without hardware investments.

### 9. How does Snowflake achieve high availability and disaster recovery?
   - Data automatically replicated across availability zones within a region. Offers database replication across regions/clouds for disaster recovery. Failover/failback capabilities, continuous data protection through Time Travel and Fail-safe, and 99.9% uptime SLA (Business Critical offers 99.99%).

### 10. What cloud platforms support Snowflake (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
   - Available on AWS (Amazon S3), Microsoft Azure (Azure Blob Storage), and Google Cloud Platform (Google Cloud Storage). Can replicate data across different cloud providers, though cross-cloud data sharing has limitations. Choice depends on organizational cloud strategy.

## Virtual Warehouses & Compute

### 1. What are Virtual Warehouses in Snowflake?
   - Virtual warehouses are clusters of compute resources that execute queries and DML operations. Each warehouse is independent with its own CPU, memory, and temporary storage. They can be started, stopped, resized, and scaled without affecting others or the data layer.

### 2. How do you size Virtual Warehouses (X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, etc.)?
   - Sizes: X-Small (1 credit/hour), Small (2), Medium (4), Large (8), X-Large (16), 2X-Large (32), 3X-Large (64), 4X-Large (128). Each size doubles the compute resources and cost. Choose based on query complexity, data volume, and concurrency needs.

### 3. What is the difference between scaling up vs scaling out?
   - **Scaling up**: Increase warehouse size (Small â†’ Medium) for faster individual query execution, better for complex queries on large datasets.
   - **Scaling out**: Add clusters to handle more concurrent users/queries without improving single query speed. Use multi-cluster warehouses for scaling out.

### 4. Explain multi-cluster warehouses and auto-scaling
   - Multi-cluster warehouses automatically add/remove clusters based on query load. Configure min/max clusters and scaling policy (Standard: favors conserving credits, Economy: favors starting clusters). Handles concurrency spikes without manual intervention, available in Enterprise edition and above.

### 5. What is auto-suspend and auto-resume for warehouses?
   - **Auto-suspend**: Automatically stops warehouse after specified idle period (e.g., 5 minutes), stopping credit consumption.
   - **Auto-resume**: Automatically starts suspended warehouse when query submitted. Best practice: enable both to minimize costs while maintaining availability.

### 6. How do warehouses handle concurrent queries?
   - Single cluster queues queries when all compute slots occupied (typically 8 queries per cluster). Multi-cluster warehouses add clusters to handle additional concurrent queries. Queries within a warehouse share cache but execute independently. Different warehouses never share compute resources.

### 7. What factors influence Virtual Warehouse performance?
   - Warehouse size, query complexity, data volume, clustering keys, result cache hits, concurrent query load, network latency, and micro-partition pruning efficiency. Smaller warehouses may spill to disk for complex queries, while larger ones keep more in memory.

### 8. How do you determine the right warehouse size for your workload?
   - Start small and monitor query execution time. Scale up if: queries spill to disk, compilation takes too long, or performance degrades. Scale out for high concurrency. Review query profile for bottlenecks. Balance performance needs with cost constraints. Use dedicated warehouses for different workloads (ETL vs reporting).

### 9. What is the difference between Standard, Enterprise, and Business Critical editions regarding warehouse capabilities?
   - **Standard**: Basic warehouses, no multi-cluster.
   - **Enterprise**: Multi-cluster warehouses, materialized views, up to 90-day Time Travel.
   - **Business Critical**: All Enterprise features plus enhanced security, customer-managed keys, tri-secret secure, HIPAA compliance, and dedicated metadata store.

### 10. How do compute credits work in Snowflake?
   - Credits measure compute consumption. Each warehouse size consumes credits per second of runtime (billed per-second with 60-second minimum). Example: Medium warehouse (4 credits/hour) running 30 minutes = 2 credits. Cloud services also consume credits but typically covered if under 10% of daily compute usage.

## Data Loading & Ingestion

### 1. What is Snowpipe and how does it work?
   - Snowpipe enables continuous, automated data ingestion as files arrive in a stage. Uses serverless compute (no warehouse needed) triggered by cloud events (S3 notifications, Azure Event Grid) or REST API. Loads data within minutes, charged per-file processing. Ideal for streaming/real-time data pipelines.

### 2. Explain the COPY INTO command and its parameters
   - `COPY INTO <table> FROM <stage>` bulk loads data. Key parameters: `FILES` (specific files), `PATTERN` (regex filter), `FILE_FORMAT` (CSV, JSON, etc.), `ON_ERROR` (continue/skip/abort), `VALIDATION_MODE` (validate without loading), `FORCE` (reload files), and `PURGE` (delete source files after load).

### 3. What are the different methods to load data into Snowflake?
   - Bulk loading via COPY INTO, continuous loading via Snowpipe, web UI upload (small files), SnowSQL PUT command, third-party ETL tools (Fivetran, Matillion), Kafka connector, INSERT statements (not recommended for large volumes), and external tables (query without loading).

### 4. How do you load structured vs semi-structured data?
   - **Structured**: CSV/delimited files loaded directly into defined columns.
   - **Semi-structured**: JSON/Avro/Parquet loaded into VARIANT column, then parsed using path notation or FLATTEN. Snowflake automatically detects and optimizes semi-structured data storage.

### 5. What are Stages in Snowflake (Internal vs External)?
   - **Internal stages**: Snowflake-managed storage (user, table, named stages) within Snowflake account.
   - **External stages**: Reference external cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) with credentials. External stages don't store data, just metadata for accessing external locations.

### 6. Explain the three types of internal stages (User, Table, Named)
   - **User stage**: Per-user storage (@~), no separate creation needed, personal files.
   - **Table stage**: Per-table storage (@%table_name), tied to table lifecycle.
   - **Named stage**: Created explicitly (CREATE STAGE), shared across users, configurable file formats, most flexible for enterprise use.

### 7. How do you load data from AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or GCP?
   - Create external stage with cloud credentials (AWS IAM role, Azure SAS token, GCS service account). Configure storage integration for secure access. Use COPY INTO from stage URL. Enable cloud notifications for Snowpipe automation. Best practice: use storage integration instead of hard-coded credentials.

### 8. What file formats does Snowflake support (CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, XML)?
   - Structured: CSV, TSV, delimited text. Semi-structured: JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, XML. Create file format objects to define parsing rules (delimiters, compression, date formats, null handling). Parquet and ORC offer best compression and performance.

### 9. How do you handle error handling during data loading?
   - Use `ON_ERROR` option: CONTINUE (skip errors), SKIP_FILE (skip entire file on error), ABORT_STATEMENT (default, stop on first error). Set `ERROR_LIMIT` for maximum allowed errors. Query `VALIDATE` function or COPY INTO history to identify problematic files/rows. Review rejected records in metadata.

### 10. What is bulk loading vs continuous loading (Snowpipe)?
   - **Bulk loading**: Manual/scheduled COPY INTO, uses warehouse compute, loads large batches, suitable for periodic loads.
   - **Continuous loading**: Automated Snowpipe, serverless compute, event-driven micro-batches, ideal for streaming/real-time scenarios, higher per-TB cost but better latency.

### 11. How do you monitor Snowpipe execution?
   - Query `SYSTEM$PIPE_STATUS()` for current state, `ACCOUNT_USAGE.PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY` for historical metrics, `ACCOUNT_USAGE.COPY_HISTORY` for loaded files. Monitor via web UI Snowpipe section. Set up alerts for failures. Track credit consumption separately from warehouse usage.

### 12. What is the difference between COPY and INSERT for loading data?
   - **COPY**: Optimized bulk loading from files, parallel processing, best performance for large volumes, supports file formats and error handling.
   - **INSERT**: Row-by-row or small batch inserts, used for application writes or loading from query results, slower for large datasets, no direct file support.

## Data Unloading & Export

### 1. How do you unload data from Snowflake?
   - Use `COPY INTO <location>` to export table/query results to internal or external stages. Specify file format (CSV, JSON, Parquet), compression, partitioning, and file size limits. Data exported in parallel for performance. Retrieve files using GET command or directly from cloud storage.

### 2. What is the COPY INTO location command?
   - `COPY INTO @stage/path FROM table/query` exports data to specified location. Parameters: `FILE_FORMAT`, `PARTITION BY` (organize into folders), `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `OVERWRITE`, `SINGLE` (single file vs multiple), `HEADER` (include column names), and `COMPRESSION`.

### 3. How do you export data to S3, Azure, or GCP?
   - Create external stage pointing to cloud storage with appropriate credentials. Use COPY INTO @external_stage. Configure storage integration for security. Files written directly to cloud storage. Monitor with query history. Alternative: unload to internal stage then download with GET.

### 4. What file formats can you export data to?
   - Delimited files (CSV, TSV, pipe-delimited), JSON (structured or newline-delimited), Parquet (columnar, compressed). Specify format in COPY command or use predefined file format object. Parquet recommended for large exports due to compression and performance.

### 5. How do you partition data during unloading?
   - Use `PARTITION BY` clause with column expression: `COPY INTO @stage FROM table PARTITION BY date_col`. Creates folder structure based on partition values (e.g., /date=2024-01-01/). Useful for organizing exports by date, region, or category for downstream processing.

## Semi-Structured Data

### 1. How does Snowflake handle semi-structured data (JSON, XML, Avro, Parquet)?
   - Stores semi-structured data in VARIANT columns without requiring schema definition. Automatically detects and optimizes storage, compresses efficiently, and maintains statistics for query optimization. Supports direct querying using path notation and SQL functions without ETL transformation.

### 2. What is the VARIANT data type?
   - Universal data type for storing semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet). Stores up to 16 MB per value. Snowflake automatically determines internal representation and optimizes storage. Enables schema flexibility while maintaining query performance through columnar compression and metadata.

### 3. How do you query JSON data in Snowflake?
   - Use colon notation: `SELECT json_col:name::STRING, json_col:age::INTEGER FROM table`. Use bracket notation for arrays: `json_col:items[0]`. Cast to appropriate type using `::` operator. Access nested elements: `json_col:address.city::STRING`.

### 4. What is the FLATTEN function and when do you use it?
   - FLATTEN transforms nested/array data into relational rows. Use for unnesting JSON arrays or exploring hierarchical structures. Example: `SELECT value:id FROM table, LATERAL FLATTEN(input => json_col:items)`. Essential for converting one-to-many relationships in JSON to separate rows.

### 5. How do you extract nested attributes from JSON?
   - Use dot notation for nested objects: `data:user.profile.email::STRING`. Combine with FLATTEN for arrays within objects: `FLATTEN(input => data:orders)`. Use GET_PATH for dynamic paths. Cast final values to appropriate SQL types for operations.

### 6. What are best practices for storing semi-structured data?
   - Load raw JSON into VARIANT column initially, create views extracting common fields, use materialized views for frequently accessed attributes, enable search optimization for point lookups, avoid extracting all fields (leverage lazy parsing), partition large JSON datasets, and monitor storage growth.

### 7. How do you optimize queries on semi-structured data?
   - Extract frequently queried fields into regular columns, create materialized views for common access patterns, use FLATTEN judiciously (expensive operation), add clustering keys on extracted values, enable search optimization service, cast data types early in queries, and avoid SELECT * on VARIANT columns.

## Performance Optimization

### 1. How do you optimize query performance in Snowflake?
   - Use clustering keys for large tables, leverage result cache by running identical queries, select only needed columns, use appropriate warehouse size, partition data logically, minimize DISTINCT and GROUP BY on high-cardinality columns, use materialized views for complex aggregations, and analyze query profiles to identify bottlenecks.

### 2. What is clustering and when should you use it?
   - Clustering reorganizes micro-partitions based on specified columns to improve query pruning. Use for: large tables (multi-TB), columns frequently in WHERE/JOIN clauses, queries scanning large data portions. Don't over-cluster small tables or rarely queried columns. Monitor clustering depth and maintenance costs.

### 3. Explain clustering keys and how to choose them
   - Clustering key defines column(s) used to co-locate related data in micro-partitions. Choose columns: frequently filtered, used in joins, have reasonable cardinality (not too high/low), appear in range predicates. Multi-column keys possible but increase maintenance cost. Typically choose 1-3 columns maximum.

### 4. What is the difference between automatic and manual clustering?
   - **Automatic**: Snowflake continuously maintains clustering in background as data changes (Enterprise+ edition).
   - **Manual**: Explicitly run `ALTER TABLE ... RECLUSTER`. Automatic recommended for actively changing tables. Manual for one-time optimization or cost control. Monitor with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION`.

### 5. How do you identify queries that need optimization?
   - Review Query History for long execution times, examine Query Profile for excessive scanning/spilling, check bytes scanned vs returned ratio, identify queries with high queuing time, monitor warehouse utilization, analyze EXPLAIN plans, and track top consumers in ACCOUNT_USAGE views.

### 6. What is query pruning and how does micro-partitioning enable it?
   - Query pruning skips irrelevant micro-partitions without scanning data. Snowflake's metadata tracks min/max values per column per micro-partition. When query has WHERE clause, optimizer eliminates partitions outside the range. Reduces I/O dramatically. Works best with clustered data and selective predicates.

### 7. How do you use the Query Profile to diagnose performance issues?
   - Query Profile visualizes execution plan with timing and data volume per operator. Look for: large TableScan percentages (add clustering), spilling to disk (increase warehouse size), expensive joins (optimize join order), high network transfer (reduce data movement). Identify most time-consuming operators for targeted optimization.

### 8. What causes "Warehouse Overloaded" errors and how do you resolve them?
   - Occurs when query queue exceeds capacity. Causes: too many concurrent queries, insufficient warehouse size, long-running queries blocking queue. Solutions: increase warehouse size (scale up), enable multi-cluster (scale out), optimize slow queries, use separate warehouses for different workloads, adjust timeout parameters.

### 9. How do you optimize credit consumption and costs?
   - Right-size warehouses, enable auto-suspend (5-10 minutes idle), use auto-resume, implement resource monitors, separate workloads by warehouse, avoid over-clustering, use transient tables for temporary data, reduce Time Travel retention where possible, monitor query efficiency, and schedule non-urgent workloads during off-peak.

### 10. What are materialized views and when should you use them?
   - Pre-computed query results automatically maintained by Snowflake. Use for: frequently executed expensive aggregations, complex joins run repeatedly, dashboard queries, data mart summaries. Trade-off: storage cost and maintenance compute vs query performance. Automatically refreshed when base tables change (Enterprise+ edition).

### 11. How do you handle large result sets efficiently?
   - Use LIMIT for testing, implement pagination (LIMIT/OFFSET), export to stage rather than client, use result caching for repeated queries, consider materialized views for aggregations, stream results instead of fetching all at once, and unload to cloud storage for external processing.

## Caching Mechanisms

### 1. Explain Snowflake's three-tier caching architecture
   - **Metadata Cache**: Query compilation results, object metadata, statistics (persists in cloud services).
   - **Result Cache**: Complete query results for 24 hours (shared across all warehouses).
   - **Local Disk Cache**: Raw data cached on warehouse SSD (persists until warehouse suspended). These layers work together to minimize compute and I/O.

### 2. What is the Result Cache and how long does it persist?
   - Stores exact query results globally for 24 hours. Any user running identical query gets instant results with zero compute cost. Invalidated when underlying data changes. Works across warehouses and sessions. Requires identical SQL text (case-sensitive, whitespace matters). Provides dramatic performance boost for repeated queries.

### 3. What is the Local Disk Cache (Warehouse Cache)?
   - Stores raw micro-partition data on warehouse SSD storage. Persists while warehouse runs, cleared on suspension. Improves performance for repeated scans of same data within a warehouse. Not shared between warehouses. Particularly beneficial for iterative queries on same tables during active sessions.

### 4. What is the Metadata Cache?
   - Stores table statistics, column min/max values, object definitions, and query compilation results in cloud services layer. Enables query pruning without data access. Persists indefinitely. Shared across all warehouses. Accelerates query planning and optimization. Updated automatically as data changes.

### 5. How do caching layers improve query performance?
   - Result cache eliminates query execution entirely. Local disk cache avoids remote storage I/O (10-100x faster). Metadata cache enables partition pruning without scanning. Together, they reduce compute time, network transfer, and storage I/O, providing substantial cost savings and performance improvements for repeated or similar queries.

### 6. When does Snowflake invalidate cached results?
   - Result cache invalidated when: underlying table data modified (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE), 24-hour expiration reached, table schema changes, or deterministic functions return different values. Metadata cache updates automatically with schema changes. Local cache cleared only when warehouse suspended or restarted.

## Time Travel & Data Recovery

### 1. What is Time Travel in Snowflake?
   - Feature enabling access to historical data that has been modified or deleted within a retention period. Query previous versions of tables, restore dropped objects, and analyze data changes. Default 1-day retention (Standard), up to 90 days (Enterprise+). Uses snapshot-based approach without performance overhead.

### 2. How do you configure Time Travel retention period (1-90 days)?
   - Set at account, database, schema, or table level: `ALTER TABLE my_table SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7`. Standard edition: 0-1 day. Enterprise+: 0-90 days. Lower-level settings override higher levels. Longer retention increases storage costs. Transient tables limited to 1 day maximum.

### 3. How do you query historical data using Time Travel?
   - Use `AT` or `BEFORE` clause with timestamp, offset, or statement ID: `SELECT * FROM table AT(TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-15 10:00:00')`, `SELECT * FROM table AT(OFFSET => -3600)` (1 hour ago), `SELECT * FROM table BEFORE(STATEMENT => '01a1234b-...')`.

### 4. What is the AT or BEFORE clause?
   - **AT**: Query data as it existed at exact point in time or statement.
   - **BEFORE**: Query data before specified change (excludes that change). 
   
   Syntax: `AT|BEFORE(TIMESTAMP => ..., OFFSET => ..., STATEMENT => ...)`. Useful for point-in-time analysis and recovery scenarios.

### 5. How does Time Travel affect storage costs?
   - Historical data maintained for retention period consumes storage. Charged for delta changes, not full copies due to micro-partition immutability. Cost proportional to data change frequency and retention period. Use `TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS` view to monitor. Balance compliance needs against storage costs.

### 6. What are the limitations of Time Travel?
   - Cannot access data beyond retention period, permanent tables only (not external), transient tables limited to 1 day, temporary tables have 0-1 day, dropped objects retained only during retention window, and after Fail-safe period data unrecoverable. Not a replacement for backups.

### 7. How do you restore dropped tables, schemas, or databases?
   - Use UNDROP command within retention period: `UNDROP TABLE table_name`, `UNDROP SCHEMA schema_name`, `UNDROP DATABASE db_name`. Works only if object not permanently purged. Alternative: create table from historical data using `CREATE TABLE recovered AS SELECT * FROM dropped_table AT(...)`.

### 8. What is Fail-safe and how does it differ from Time Travel?
   - Fail-safe is 7-day recovery period after Time Travel expires, accessible only by Snowflake Support for disaster recovery. Non-queryable by users. Applies to permanent tables only. Provides additional protection but incurs storage costs. Time Travel is user-accessible; Fail-safe is emergency-only Snowflake Support intervention.

## Zero-Copy Cloning

### 1. What is Zero-Copy Cloning?
   - Creates complete, writable copy of database, schema, or table without duplicating underlying data. Uses metadata pointers to existing micro-partitions. Instantaneous regardless of data size. Storage charged only for changes made to clone after creation. Leverages immutable micro-partition architecture.

### 2. How do you create clones of databases, schemas, or tables?
   - `CREATE TABLE clone_table CLONE source_table`, `CREATE SCHEMA clone_schema CLONE source_schema`, `CREATE DATABASE clone_db CLONE source_db`. Can clone at specific time: `CLONE source_table AT(TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-15')`. Include Time Travel reference to clone historical versions.

### 3. How does cloning work without duplicating storage?
   - Snowflake's immutable micro-partitions enable metadata-only cloning. Clone initially references same physical partitions as source. Only when clone is modified do new micro-partitions get created (copy-on-write). Efficient use of storage while providing full isolation between clone and source.

### 4. When are clones useful (testing, development, analytics)?
   - Development/testing environments without production data duplication, creating sandboxes for experimentation, before major schema changes (backup), ad-hoc analysis without affecting production, data science model training, reporting on specific point-in-time snapshot, and zero-downtime migrations.

### 5. How do changes to clones affect storage?
   - Initially zero additional storage. As clone or source is modified, divergence creates new micro-partitions charged to respective object. Storage cost proportional to data changes, not total size. Dropped clones release only their unique micro-partitions. Original and clone share unchanged partitions efficiently.

## Data Sharing

### 1. What is Snowflake's data sharing feature?
   - Secure mechanism to share live data between Snowflake accounts without copying or transferring. Provider creates share granting access to database objects; consumers access data directly from provider's storage. Real-time access, no ETL, no data movement. Available across regions and cloud platforms with replication.

### 2. How do you create and manage data shares?
   - Provider: `CREATE SHARE share_name`, `GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE db TO SHARE share_name`, `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE table TO SHARE share_name`, add consumer accounts. Consumer: creates database from share. Manage via `SHOW SHARES`, `ALTER SHARE`, revoke with `REVOKE` commands.

### 3. What is the difference between sharing data vs copying data?
   - **Sharing**: No data duplication, real-time updates, single source of truth, consumer pays compute only, provider controls access.
   - **Copying**: Full data duplication, point-in-time snapshot, requires ETL, both parties pay storage, consumer owns copy. Sharing ideal for live data, controlled access scenarios.

### 4. How do you share data across different Snowflake accounts?
   - Create share object, grant privileges on database objects to share, add consumer account identifiers (organization.account format). Consumer creates database from share URL/locator. Works within same region directly. Cross-region requires database replication first, then sharing from replica.

### 5. What is a Reader Account?
   - Special Snowflake account created by provider for consumers without existing Snowflake subscription. Provider manages and pays for reader account compute. Used for sharing data with external partners/customers who don't have Snowflake. Limited functionality compared to full accounts. Managed via provider's account.

### 6. How does secure data sharing work?
   - Uses Snowflake's services layer to grant access without data movement. Consumers query provider's storage directly through separate compute. Row-level security and secure views enforce access controls. Provider retains full control, can revoke anytime. All queries tracked and auditable. Encrypted in transit and at rest.

### 7. Can you share data across different cloud platforms?
   - Yes, but requires replication. Direct sharing only within same cloud provider and region. For cross-cloud/cross-region: replicate database to target region/cloud, then share from replica. Replication incurs data transfer and storage costs. Consumer accesses shared replica in their preferred cloud.

### 8. What are the security considerations for data sharing?
   - Use secure views to hide sensitive columns/rows, implement row access policies, never share personally identifiable information without masking, monitor consumer queries via `ACCOUNT_USAGE`, regularly audit shares and privileges, use reader accounts for external parties, consider data residency regulations, and revoke access promptly when needed.

## Streams & Change Data Capture (CDC)

### 1. What are Streams in Snowflake?
   - Objects that track DML changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) on tables, views, or directory tables. Enable CDC by recording delta between two transactional points. Used for incremental processing, avoiding full table scans. Consume stream data using DML operations, which advances stream offset.

### 2. How do Streams capture change data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)?
   - Streams add metadata columns: `METADATA$ACTION` (INSERT/DELETE), `METADATA$ISUPDATE` (TRUE for updates), `METADATA$ROW_ID` (unique identifier). Updates appear as DELETE (old) + INSERT (new). Tracks changes using table versioning, not triggers. Minimal overhead on source table operations.

### 3. What are the different types of Streams (Standard, Append-only, Insert-only)?
   - **Standard**: Tracks all DML changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), shows net changes.
   - **Append-only**: Tracks only INSERT, ignores updates/deletes, better performance for insert-only tables.
   - **Insert-only**: Similar to append-only, used for external tables and directory tables.

### 4. How do you create and use Streams?
   - Create: `CREATE STREAM my_stream ON TABLE source_table`. Query: `SELECT * FROM my_stream` shows pending changes. Consume: `INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM my_stream` (advances offset). Stream becomes empty after consumption. Use in ETL pipelines with Tasks for automation.

### 5. How do Streams work with Time Travel?
   - Streams rely on Time Travel to track changes. Stale stream occurs if source table changes exceed Time Travel retention before consumption. Stream becomes invalid if underlying data no longer accessible. Regular consumption (within retention period) prevents staleness. Monitor with `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()`.

### 6. What happens when a Stream is consumed?
   - DML operation reading stream advances stream offset to current table version. Stream appears empty until new changes occur. Multiple statements in same transaction see same stream data. Changes committed before consumption timestamp disappear. Transactional consistency maintained automatically.

### 7. How do you implement CDC using Streams?
   - Create stream on source table, create Task to process stream periodically, in Task: read stream data, apply business logic, write to target (advancing stream), schedule Task execution. Pattern: `CREATE TASK process_changes AS INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM my_stream WHERE condition`. Combine with MERGE for upserts.

## Tasks & Orchestration

### 1. What are Tasks in Snowflake?
   - Scheduled SQL statements that run on defined schedule or based on predecessor completion. Enable workflow automation within Snowflake without external schedulers. Support cron expressions, predecessor dependencies, conditional execution, and serverless or warehouse-based compute. Used for ETL, data pipelines, and maintenance operations.

### 2. How do you create and schedule Tasks?
   - `CREATE TASK my_task WAREHOUSE = wh SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 9 * * * UTC' AS INSERT INTO target SELECT * FROM source`. Schedule using cron or time intervals. Resume task: `ALTER TASK my_task RESUME`. Suspend: `ALTER TASK my_task SUSPEND`. Tasks created in suspended state by default.

### 3. How do you chain Tasks together (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph)?
   - Use `AFTER` clause to define dependencies: `CREATE TASK child_task AFTER parent_task AS ...`. Create tree structure with one root task. Root task scheduled; children run on parent completion. Enables complex workflows. Resume in reverse order (children first, then root).

### 4. What is the difference between standalone Tasks and Task trees?
   - **Standalone**: Single task with schedule, runs independently.
   - **Task tree**: Multiple tasks with dependencies (DAG), only root scheduled, children triggered by predecessor. Tree allows parallel execution of independent branches, conditional logic, and complex ETL orchestration.

### 5. How do you monitor Task execution?
   - Query `TASK_HISTORY()` table function: `SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY()) ORDER BY SCHEDULED_TIME DESC`. Check `ACCOUNT_USAGE.TASK_HISTORY` for detailed history. Monitor state (SUCCEEDED, FAILED, SKIPPED), execution time, and error messages. Set up alerts for failures.

### 6. What causes a Task to be stuck in "SCHEDULED" state?
   - Insufficient warehouse resources, warehouse suspended with no auto-resume, serverless task quota exceeded, long-running predecessor blocking execution, or warehouse size too small for workload. Check warehouse state, resize if needed, or switch to serverless tasks for automatic resource management.

### 7. How do you handle Task failures and retries?
   - Configure `TASK_AUTO_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (1-10 attempts). Tasks retry automatically on transient failures. Implement error handling in SQL logic using TRY/CATCH blocks. Log errors to separate table. Set up alert notifications. Use conditional execution with SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA() to skip unnecessary runs.

### 8. What are Serverless Tasks?
   - Tasks using Snowflake-managed compute instead of user-defined warehouses. Specify `USER_TASK_MANAGED_INITIAL_WAREHOUSE_SIZE` instead of WAREHOUSE. Snowflake automatically provisions and scales resources. Simplifies management, optimizes costs for variable workloads. Billed per-second compute consumption.

### 9. How do Tasks integrate with Streams for CDC pipelines?
   - Task processes Stream data on schedule: `CREATE TASK process_stream SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE' WHEN SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('my_stream') AS MERGE INTO target USING my_stream ...`. WHEN clause prevents empty runs. Stream offset advances after successful task execution. Automates incremental data processing without external tools.

## Views & Materialized Views

### 1. What is the difference between Views and Materialized Views?
   - **Views**: Virtual tables, query stored not data, executed each time queried, no storage cost, always current.
   - **Materialized Views**: Physical storage of query results, pre-computed, automatically refreshed when base tables change (Enterprise+), faster queries but storage cost and maintenance overhead.

### 2. When should you use Materialized Views?
   - Use for: frequently executed expensive aggregations, complex multi-table joins queried repeatedly, dashboard queries with consistent patterns, data mart summarizations. Avoid for: frequently changing base tables, simple queries, one-time analytics, or when freshness requirements are strict (refresh lag exists).

### 3. How are Materialized Views maintained (automatic refresh)?
   - Snowflake automatically refreshes materialized views in background when base table data changes. Uses incremental refresh when possible (faster than full rebuild). Refresh happens asynchronously, may have slight lag. Query optimizer automatically uses materialized view when beneficial. Enterprise edition and above only.

### 4. What are Secure Views?
   - Views with hidden definition from unauthorized users. Query optimizer doesn't expose view logic to prevent reverse-engineering. Used to protect sensitive business logic and implement row-level security. Created with `CREATE SECURE VIEW`. Performance trade-off: some optimizations disabled to maintain security.

### 5. How do Secure Views protect data?
   - Hide view definition from users without ownership, prevent schema inference through error messages, enforce security policies transparently, enable secure data sharing (consumers can't see filtering logic). Commonly used for row-level security, column masking, and sharing data with external parties while hiding implementation details.

### 6. What are the performance implications of Secure Views?
   - Secure views bypass certain query optimizations (predicate pushdown, column pruning may be limited) to prevent information leakage. Can result in slower performance compared to regular views. Use only when security requirements justify trade-off. Materialized secure views combine security with performance for frequently accessed data.

## Security & Access Control

### 1. Explain role-based access control (RBAC) in Snowflake
   - Snowflake uses RBAC where privileges granted to roles, roles assigned to users. Users can have multiple roles, switch active role during session. Roles can inherit from other roles (hierarchy). Objects owned by roles, not users. Provides flexible, scalable security model following principle of least privilege.

### 2. What are the system-defined roles (ACCOUNTADMIN, SECURITYADMIN, SYSADMIN, USERADMIN, PUBLIC)?
   - **ACCOUNTADMIN**: Top-level, account management, billing.
   - **SECURITYADMIN**: Manage users, roles, grants globally.
   - **SYSADMIN**: Create warehouses, databases, objects.
   - **USERADMIN**: User and role management (subset of SECURITYADMIN).
   - **PUBLIC**: Default role, auto-granted to all users, minimal privileges. Use sparingly.

### 3. How do you design a role hierarchy?
   - Start with functional roles (e.g., DATA_ENGINEER, ANALYST), inherit from SYSADMIN. Grant object-specific privileges to functional roles. Create environment-specific roles (DEV, PROD). Use role hierarchy to inherit privileges. SECURITYADMIN manages security, SYSADMIN manages objects. ACCOUNTADMIN used only for critical administration. Avoid granting directly to PUBLIC.

### 4. What is the principle of least privilege?
   - Grant minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their job. Start with no access, add only required privileges. Use specific grants (SELECT on specific tables) vs broad grants (ALL PRIVILEGES). Regularly audit and revoke unused permissions. Reduces security risk from compromised accounts or insider threats.

### 5. How do you grant and revoke privileges?
   - Grant: `GRANT privilege ON object TO ROLE role_name`. Example: `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE sales TO ROLE analyst`. Revoke: `REVOKE privilege ON object FROM ROLE role_name`. Grant role to user: `GRANT ROLE role_name TO USER username`. Use GRANT OPTION for delegated permission management.

### 6. What are the different types of privileges in Snowflake?
   - **Global**: CREATE DATABASE, CREATE WAREHOUSE, CREATE ROLE.
   - **Account objects**: USAGE, MONITOR on warehouses/databases.
   - **Schema privileges**: CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW.
   - **Table/View**: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE.
   - **Ownership**: OWNERSHIP privilege.
   - **Special**: IMPORTED PRIVILEGES (for shares), APPLY MASKING POLICY.

### 7. What is object ownership and how does it work?
   - Every object has exactly one owning role with full control (ALTER, DROP, GRANT). Owner can transfer ownership. Typically SYSADMIN or custom functional role. Ownership separate from access privileges. Owner can grant access without transferring ownership. Important for managing object lifecycle and security.

### 8. How do you transfer ownership of objects?
   - `GRANT OWNERSHIP ON TABLE table_name TO ROLE new_owner_role`. Optional `COPY CURRENT GRANTS` preserves existing grants. Default `REVOKE` removes existing grants. Transfer requires OWNERSHIP privilege on object or higher role. Important for administrative changes, decommissioning roles, or reorganization.

### 9. What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and how do you enable it?
   - MFA adds second authentication factor (Duo Security) beyond password. Enable per-user via Web UI (Account â†’ Users â†’ user â†’ MFA). Users enroll using Duo Mobile app. Enforces stronger authentication, required for sensitive roles like ACCOUNTADMIN. Can't be enforced account-wide, user-by-user enrollment.

### 10. What is Federated Authentication and SSO?
   - External identity provider (Okta, ADFS, Azure AD) handles authentication via SAML 2.0. Users authenticate once, access Snowflake without separate login. Centralized user management, MFA through IdP, simplified onboarding/offboarding. Configure via security integrations. Enterprise edition and above.

### 11. How does network policy work in Snowflake?
   - Restrict access to Snowflake by IP address ranges. Create policy with allowed/blocked IPs: `CREATE NETWORK POLICY policy_name ALLOWED_IP_LIST = ('192.168.1.0/24')`. Attach to account or specific users. Blocks connections from unauthorized networks. Used for compliance and security hardening.

### 12. What IP whitelisting options are available?
   - Account-level network policy applies to all users. User-level network policy for specific users/roles. Supports IP ranges (CIDR notation), multiple ranges per policy. Can specify both allowed and blocked lists. Blocked list takes precedence. Update policies without downtime using ALTER command.

## Data Encryption

### 1. How does Snowflake encrypt data at rest?
   - All data automatically encrypted using AES-256 encryption in CBC mode. Snowflake manages encryption keys hierarchically: account master key, table master keys, file keys. Encryption transparent to users. Applies to all data in cloud storage, metadata, temporary files, and internal stages. No configuration required, always enabled.

### 2. What encryption standards does Snowflake use (AES-256)?
   - AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit keys) for data at rest. TLS 1.2+ for data in transit. Meets industry standards including FIPS 140-2. Hierarchical key model with regular key rotation. Keys encrypted with master keys. Hardware security modules protect key material in Business Critical edition.

### 3. How does Snowflake encrypt data in transit (TLS)?
   - All connections use TLS 1.2 or higher (HTTPS for web, TLS for drivers/connectors). Encrypts data between client and Snowflake, between Snowflake services, and during data loading/unloading. Supports perfect forward secrecy. Client verification via SSL certificates. Cannot disable encryption in transit.

### 4. What is end-to-end encryption?
   - Data encrypted at source, during transmission, and at rest in Snowflake. Client-side encryption before upload for sensitive data. Snowflake re-encrypts with its keys upon storage. Covers entire data lifecycle from origin to destination. Ensures data never transmitted or stored unencrypted at any point.

### 5. Can you use customer-managed keys for encryption?
   - Yes, in Business Critical edition via Tri-Secret Secure. Customer provides key through cloud provider KMS (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault). Snowflake combines customer key with Snowflake key for composite encryption. Customer can revoke access by removing key. Provides additional control over data encryption.

### 6. What is Tri-Secret Secure?
   - Business Critical feature combining three key layers: Snowflake-managed key, customer-managed key (via cloud KMS), and account master key. Provides customer control over encryption while maintaining Snowflake functionality. Customer can render data inaccessible by revoking KMS key. Meets strict regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

## Data Governance & Compliance

### 1. How do you implement data masking in Snowflake?
   - Create masking policy: `CREATE MASKING POLICY mask_ssn AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING -> CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ADMIN') THEN val ELSE 'XXX-XX-' || RIGHT(val,4) END`. Apply to column: `ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN ssn SET MASKING POLICY mask_ssn`. Enterprise edition required. Centralized policy management.

### 2. What is Dynamic Data Masking?
   - Runtime masking based on user role/context without altering underlying data. Policies define masking logic conditionally. Same query returns different results for different roles. Transparent to applications. Used for PII protection, regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA), and column-level security. Applied at query execution time.

### 3. What are Row Access Policies?
   - Filter table rows based on user context: `CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY sales_policy AS (region STRING) RETURNS BOOLEAN -> CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'GLOBAL_SALES' THEN TRUE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() = 'APAC_SALES' THEN region = 'APAC' ELSE FALSE END`. Apply: `ALTER TABLE sales ADD ROW ACCESS POLICY sales_policy ON (region)`. Enterprise+ feature.

### 4. How do you implement column-level security?
   - Use masking policies for sensitive columns, grant SELECT on specific columns only (`GRANT SELECT(col1, col2) ON TABLE t TO ROLE r`), create secure views exposing subset of columns, use VARIANT with controlled access to nested fields, combine with row access policies for multi-dimensional security.

### 5. What are Tags and how do you use them for governance?
   - Key-value metadata attached to objects for classification and discovery. Create: `CREATE TAG pii_level ALLOWED_VALUES 'high', 'medium', 'low'`. Apply: `ALTER TABLE customers SET TAG pii_level = 'high'`. Query: `SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TAG_REFERENCES(...))`. Use for data classification, compliance tracking, cost allocation, and access control.

### 6. How do you track data lineage in Snowflake?
   - Use `ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` view to track data reads/writes, query `QUERY_HISTORY` for transformations, leverage tags for manual lineage tracking. Third-party tools (Alation, Collibra) integrate for visual lineage. Stream and task history shows pipeline flows. Object dependencies visible in INFORMATION_SCHEMA views.

### 7. What compliance certifications does Snowflake have (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?
   - SOC 1 Type II, SOC 2 Type II, PCI-DSS, HIPAA (Business Critical), ISO/IEC 27001, FedRAMP (GovCloud), HITRUST CSF, IRAP (Australia), GxP (life sciences). Regional compliance varies. Business Critical edition offers enhanced compliance features. Customers responsible for proper configuration and usage for compliance.

## Database Objects

### 1. What is the hierarchy of database objects in Snowflake?
   - Account â†’ Database â†’ Schema â†’ Tables/Views/Stages/File Formats/Sequences/Stored Procedures/UDFs. Warehouses exist at account level, not within databases. Each level contains objects from level below. Privileges flow down hierarchy. Naming: `database.schema.object` or use context with USE commands.

### 2. How do you create and manage Databases?
   - Create: `CREATE DATABASE db_name`. Clone: `CREATE DATABASE new_db CLONE source_db`. Drop: `DROP DATABASE db_name`. Set properties: Data retention, tags. Use `SHOW DATABASES`, `ALTER DATABASE` for management. Control with USAGE and CREATE privileges. Organize by business domain or environment (dev/prod).

### 3. What are Schemas and how do they organize tables?
   - Schemas are logical containers within databases grouping related objects. Provide namespace separation, organize by functional area (sales, marketing, staging), control access at schema level. Create: `CREATE SCHEMA schema_name`. Each database has default PUBLIC and INFORMATION_SCHEMA schemas.

### 4. What are Transient Tables and when should you use them?
   - Tables with reduced data protection: no Fail-safe (only Time Travel up to 1 day). Lower storage costs (~25% less than permanent). Use for: temporary/intermediate data, ETL staging, data that can be re-created, non-critical analytics. Create: `CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE table_name ...`.

### 5. What are Temporary Tables and how do they differ from Transient Tables?
   - **Temporary**: Session-scoped, auto-dropped on session end, invisible to other users, 0-1 day Time Travel, no Fail-safe.
   - **Transient**: Persistent until explicitly dropped, visible to users with privileges, 0-1 day Time Travel, no Fail-safe. Temporary for session work; Transient for staging/intermediate persistence.

### 6. What are External Tables and how do you use them?
   - Tables referencing data in external storage (S3, Azure, GCS) without loading into Snowflake. Metadata stored, data stays external. Create: `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_sales ... LOCATION=@external_stage`. Query like regular tables but slower performance. Use for: infrequently accessed data, data lake queries, cost optimization.

### 7. How do you manage constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)?
   - Define constraints in CREATE/ALTER: `CREATE TABLE t (id INT PRIMARY KEY, email STRING UNIQUE NOT NULL)`. Add: `ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT fk_name FOREIGN KEY (col) REFERENCES other_table(col)`. Note: constraints defined for metadata/documentation but NOT ENFORCED except NOT NULL. Tools use for optimization hints.

### 8. Are constraints enforced in Snowflake?
   - Only NOT NULL enforced. PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE defined but not enforced (documented for metadata purposes). Snowflake trusts data correctness from ETL processes. Allows flexibility but requires data quality assurance upstream. Query optimizer may use constraint metadata for optimization hints.

## Data Types

### 1. What data types does Snowflake support?
   - **Numeric**: NUMBER, INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL.
   - **String**: VARCHAR, CHAR, STRING, TEXT.
   - **Binary**: BINARY, VARBINARY.
   - **Logical**: BOOLEAN.
   - **Date/Time**: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP_LTZ/NTZ/TZ.
   - **Semi-structured**: VARIANT, OBJECT, ARRAY.
   - **Geospatial**: GEOGRAPHY, GEOMETRY (preview).

### 2. What is the VARIANT data type used for?
   - Universal type for storing semi-structured data (JSON, Avro, Parquet, XML). Stores up to 16 MB per value. Enables schema-less ingestion while maintaining query performance. Snowflake optimizes storage internally. Access using colon notation. Cast elements to specific types for operations. Flexible but requires type casting in queries.

### 3. What is the GEOGRAPHY data type?
   - Stores geospatial data in WKT, WKB, EWKT, EWKB, or GeoJSON formats. Supports points, lines, polygons, multi-geometries. Use functions: ST_DISTANCE, ST_INTERSECTS, ST_AREA, ST_CONTAINS. Enables location-based analytics, spatial joins, geographic visualizations. Particularly useful for mapping, logistics, and location intelligence.

### 4. How do you work with DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP data types?
   - DATE stores date without time. TIME stores time without date or timezone. TIMESTAMP includes date and time. Use functions: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATE_TRUNC, TO_DATE, TO_TIMESTAMP. Default formats configurable at session/account level. Supports arithmetic operations and comparisons.

### 5. What is TIMESTAMP_NTZ vs TIMESTAMP_LTZ vs TIMESTAMP_TZ?
   - **TIMESTAMP_NTZ** (No Time Zone): Stores datetime without timezone, user interprets context.
   - **TIMESTAMP_LTZ** (Local Time Zone): Stored in UTC, displayed in user's session timezone.
   - **TIMESTAMP_TZ** (Time Zone): Stores timezone offset with value. 
   
   Choose based on: NTZ for local time, LTZ for global applications, TZ when timezone matters.

## Stored Procedures & UDFs

### 1. What are Stored Procedures in Snowflake?
   - Reusable code blocks executing procedural logic with control flow (IF, LOOP, EXCEPTION). Written in JavaScript, Snowflake Scripting (SQL), Python, Java, or Scala. Support transactions, dynamic SQL, and complex business logic. Execute with CALL command. Return single value or table. Used for ETL orchestration, data validation, complex transformations.

### 2. How do you create JavaScript stored procedures?
   - `CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE my_proc(arg1 NUMBER) RETURNS NUMBER LANGUAGE JAVASCRIPT AS $$ var result = ARG1 * 2; return result; $$`. Access arguments via uppercase names. Use snowflake.execute() for SQL. Return values or use table results. Handle errors with try-catch. Rich JavaScript functionality available.

### 3. What are User-Defined Functions (UDFs)?
   - Custom functions for reusable calculations returning single value per row. Written in SQL, JavaScript, Python, Java. Used in SELECT statements like built-in functions. Deterministic for caching. Example: `CREATE FUNCTION celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp FLOAT) RETURNS FLOAT AS $$ temp * 9/5 + 32 $$`. Simpler than stored procedures, no side effects.

### 4. What is the difference between SQL UDFs and JavaScript UDFs?
   - **SQL UDF**: Simple expressions, inline execution, better performance, limited to SQL capabilities.
   - **JavaScript UDF**: Complex logic, loops/conditionals, external libraries, more overhead.
   
   Choose SQL for simple transformations; JavaScript for complex calculations requiring procedural logic.

### 5. What are User-Defined Table Functions (UDTFs)?
   - Functions returning multiple rows (table). Useful for expanding/transforming data. JavaScript or SQL. Example: split string into rows, generate date series, complex unnesting. Use in FROM clause: `SELECT * FROM TABLE(my_udtf(args))`. Process input rows to produce output rows.

### 6. When should you use stored procedures vs UDFs?
   - **Stored Procedures**: Multi-statement logic, transaction control, dynamic SQL, orchestration, DML operations, procedural workflows.
   - **UDFs**: Row-level calculations, reusable expressions in queries, deterministic transformations, no side effects. Procedures for processes; UDFs for calculations.

### 7. What are External Functions?
   - Call external APIs/services from SQL queries. Connect to AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions. Create API integration, then function: `CREATE EXTERNAL FUNCTION geocode(address STRING) ... API_INTEGRATION = api_int`. Enables extending Snowflake with custom external logic, ML models, third-party services.

## Transactions & Concurrency

### 1. Does Snowflake support ACID transactions?

   Yes, fully ACID compliant.

   - **Atomicity**: All statements in transaction succeed or all fail. 
   - **Consistency**: Constraints maintained.
   - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
   - **Durability**: Committed changes persist. 

   All DML statements automatically transactional. Explicit BEGIN/COMMIT for multi-statement transactions.

### 2. How does Snowflake handle concurrent queries?
   - Multiple queries execute simultaneously on same warehouse using parallel processing. Different warehouses completely isolated. Concurrent writes don't block reads (MVCC). Readers always see consistent snapshot. No lock contention between queries. Scalability through multiple warehouses or multi-cluster warehouses for high concurrency.

### 3. What isolation level does Snowflake use?
   - READ COMMITTED (default and only) isolation level. Reads see data committed before query started. Prevents dirty reads. Concurrent writes managed through multi-version concurrency control. No phantom reads within single query execution. Provides balance between consistency and concurrency performance.

### 4. How do you implement transactional operations (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)?
   - Explicit: `BEGIN; UPDATE ...; DELETE ...; COMMIT;` or `ROLLBACK` on error. Auto-commit for single statements. Transactions support DDL and DML. Named transactions with labels. Savepoints not supported. All statements in transaction must complete successfully or all rolled back. Use for maintaining data consistency across multiple operations.

### 5. What is multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)?
   - Each transaction sees consistent snapshot of data from transaction start time. Multiple versions of data rows maintained using micro-partition immutability. Readers never blocked by writers, writers never blocked by readers. Old versions pruned after no active transactions reference them. Enables high concurrency without locks.

### 6. How does Snowflake prevent locking issues?
   - No traditional row or table locks due to MVCC. Immutable micro-partitions avoid update-in-place conflicts. Only metadata operations (DDL) may require brief locks. Concurrent DML operations automatically serialized safely. No deadlocks in typical scenarios. Optimistic concurrency control ensures consistency without blocking.

## Monitoring & Observability

### 1. How do you monitor query performance?
   - Use Query History in Web UI showing execution time, bytes scanned, warehouse used. Analyze Query Profile for detailed execution plan and bottlenecks. Set up alerts on long-running queries. Monitor via `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` for historical analysis. Track metrics: compilation time, execution time, queued time, bytes scanned, partitions scanned.

### 2. What information is available in the Query History?
   - Query text, execution time, user, warehouse, bytes scanned/returned, rows produced, compilation time, queued time, error messages, session parameters. Filterable by time range, user, warehouse, status. Export for offline analysis. Retained for 365 days in ACCOUNT_USAGE, 7 days in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.

### 3. How do you use the Query Profile?
   - Visual execution plan with timing and data volume per operator. Identifies: expensive operators (sorts, joins), partition pruning effectiveness, spilling to disk, data transfer between nodes. Color-coded by time spent. Click operators for details. Use to optimize: join order, clustering keys, warehouse sizing, query structure.

### 4. What is ACCOUNT_USAGE schema?
   - Schema in SNOWFLAKE database with detailed account metadata and historical usage. Views include: QUERY_HISTORY, WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY, TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS, LOGIN_HISTORY, ACCESS_HISTORY, PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY. Up to 365-day retention. Latency: 45 min to 3 hours. Used for auditing, cost analysis, usage patterns, governance.

### 5. What is INFORMATION_SCHEMA?
   - Standard SQL schema with current metadata about databases, tables, columns, views, functions. Real-time data, no latency. Limited historical data (7-14 days). Views: TABLES, COLUMNS, VIEWS, FUNCTIONS, LOAD_HISTORY, QUERY_HISTORY_BY_SESSION. Lightweight queries. Use for current state; ACCOUNT_USAGE for historical trends.

### 6. How do you monitor warehouse utilization?
   - Query `WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` for credit consumption over time. Check `WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY` for query load distribution. Monitor average query execution times. Track queued query counts. Use Resource Monitors for spending alerts. Identify: oversized warehouses (low utilization), undersized (high queueing), idle time for auto-suspend tuning.

### 7. How do you track credit consumption?
   - `ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY` shows warehouse credit usage. `ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY` includes cloud services. Group by warehouse, time period. Calculate costs: credits Ã— price per credit. Monitor daily/weekly trends. Identify top consumers. Set budgets with Resource Monitors. Cloud services usually <10% of compute (free tier).

### 8. What are Resource Monitors and how do you use them?
   - Set credit usage quotas and alerts to control spending. Create: `CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR mon_name WITH CREDIT_QUOTA = 1000 TRIGGERS ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND`. Assign to warehouses or account. Actions: NOTIFY (alert), SUSPEND (stop warehouse), SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE (abort queries and suspend). Prevents budget overruns.

### 9. How do you set up alerts for cost overruns?
   - Configure Resource Monitor triggers at threshold percentages (e.g., 75%, 90%, 100%). Set notification email/webhook. Use NOTIFY action for warnings, SUSPEND for hard limits. Monitor via Web UI or ACCOUNT_USAGE.RESOURCE_MONITORS. Combine with external monitoring tools (DataDog, Grafana) for comprehensive alerting.

### 10. How do you audit user activity?
   - `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`: All queries executed. `LOGIN_HISTORY`: Authentication events, failures. `ACCESS_HISTORY`: Data objects accessed. `SESSIONS`: Active/historical sessions. Track: who accessed what data when, failed login attempts, privilege changes, object creation/deletion. Essential for compliance, security investigations, usage analysis.

## Cost Management

### 1. How does Snowflake pricing work (compute vs storage)?
   - **Compute**: Billed by credits (1 credit = $2-4 depending on edition/region) per-second with 60-second minimum. Warehouse size determines credit/hour rate. 
   - **Storage**: Billed monthly for compressed storage ($23-40/TB/month). Separate charges for data transfer between regions/clouds. On-demand or pre-purchased capacity pricing available.

### 2. What are compute credits and how are they calculated?
   - Credits measure compute consumption. X-Small = 1 credit/hour, each size doubles (Small=2, Medium=4, etc.). Charged per-second (minimum 60 seconds). Multi-cluster: credits multiply by active clusters. Snowpipe/tasks use separate serverless compute credits. Cloud services usually free if <10% of daily compute; otherwise 1 credit = 1 credit.

### 3. How do you optimize costs in Snowflake?
   - Right-size warehouses, enable auto-suspend (5-10 min), use multi-cluster for concurrency not single large warehouse, separate workloads by warehouse, reduce Time Travel retention, use transient tables for staging, optimize clustering (can be expensive), schedule ETL during off-peak, eliminate redundant queries with result cache, monitor and kill long-running queries.

### 4. What is the impact of clustering on costs?
   - Automatic clustering consumes compute credits to reorganize micro-partitions. Cost depends on table size, data change frequency, number of clustering keys. Monitor with `AUTO_CLUSTERING_HISTORY`. Can be significant for large, frequently updated tables. Balance query performance gains against clustering costs. Consider manual clustering or selective usage.

### 5. How does Time Travel affect storage costs?
   - Stores changed micro-partitions for retention period. Longer retention = higher storage cost. Frequent updates increase storage. 90-day retention on large, volatile tables can be expensive. Monitor with `TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS`. Reduce retention where not needed. Transient tables (1-day max) cost less. No Fail-safe reduces costs further.

### 6. What are best practices for reducing warehouse costs?
   - Start small and scale up as needed, enable auto-suspend (5-10 minutes), use auto-resume, create dedicated warehouses for different workloads (ETL, reporting, ad-hoc), use multi-cluster for concurrency bursts, schedule resource-intensive jobs during off-peak, optimize queries to reduce execution time, leverage result cache, suspend unused warehouses.

### 7. How do you use Resource Monitors to control spending?
   - Set credit quotas at account or warehouse level. Configure thresholds (e.g., 75%, 100%) with actions: NOTIFY (email alerts), SUSPEND (prevent new queries), SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE (kill running queries). Reset frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). Provides spending guardrails and prevents runaway costs from forgotten warehouses or inefficient queries.

### 6. How do you use Snowpark?
   - Snowpark provides DataFrame API for Python, Scala, Java to build data pipelines within Snowflake. Code executed server-side using Snowflake compute. Benefits: avoid data movement, leverage Snowflake optimization, deploy UDFs. Example: `session.table('employees').filter(col('salary') > 50000).write.save_as_table('high_earners')`. Better performance than client-side processing.

### 7. What is Snowflake's integration with dbt?
   - dbt (data build tool) transforms data using SELECT statements. Snowflake adapter enables: templated SQL, incremental models, testing, documentation. Configure profiles.yml with Snowflake credentials. Run: `dbt run` to execute transformations. Use for: data modeling, analytics engineering, version-controlled transformations. Native support in dbt Cloud.

### 8. How do you integrate with Apache Airflow?
   - Use SnowflakeOperator or SnowflakeHook in DAGs. Configure connection in Airflow UI or environment. Execute SQL, run stored procedures, check query status. Use for: orchestrating ETL, scheduling tasks, monitoring pipelines. Example: automate data loading, trigger downstream processes on completion, handle dependencies across systems.

## Data Migration

### 1. How would you migrate data from an on-premise database to Snowflake?
   - **Steps**: (1) Schema migration - extract DDL, convert to Snowflake syntax, create objects. (2) Initial load - export data to files (CSV/Parquet), upload to cloud storage, COPY INTO Snowflake. (3) Incremental sync - use CDC tools or timestamps for delta loads. (4) Validation - row counts, checksums, data quality checks. (5) Cutover - switch applications to Snowflake. Use tools: Fivetran, AWS DMS, Azure Data Factory.

### 2. What are the steps for large-scale data migration?
   - **Planning**: Assess data volume, identify dependencies, plan downtime.
   - **Preparation**: Create Snowflake account, design schema, set up cloud storage.
   - **Extract**: Export source data in batches, compress files.
   - **Transfer**: Upload to S3/Azure/GCS.
   - **Load**: Parallel COPY INTO with multiple warehouses.
   - **Validate**: Compare row counts, sample data verification.
   - **Optimize**: Add clustering keys, create views.
   - **Cutover**: Update connection strings, monitor performance.

### 3. How do you migrate from AWS Redshift to Snowflake?
   - **Schema**: Export Redshift schema, translate (DISTKEYâ†’clustering, SORTKEYâ†’clustering, ENCODEâ†’automatic in Snowflake).
   - **Data**: UNLOAD from Redshift to S3, COPY INTO Snowflake from same S3 location (no data movement cost).
   - **Queries**: Update SQL for Snowflake syntax differences.
   - **ETL**: Migrate scripts/tools.
   - **Validation**: Performance testing, query comparison. 
   
   Tools: AWS SCT, SnowConvert for automation.

### 4. How do you handle schema migration?
   - Extract source schema (DDL), map data types (Snowflake equivalents), handle unsupported features (stored procedures may need rewrite), create databases/schemas/tables in Snowflake. Considerations: constraint definitions (documented not enforced), clustering vs indexing, view definitions, sequence generators. Use schema migration tools or manual conversion with validation scripts.

### 5. What tools are available for data migration?
   - **ETL tools**: Fivetran, Matillion, Talend, Informatica.
   - **Cloud-native**: AWS DMS, Azure Data Factory, Google Cloud Dataflow.
   - **Command-line**: SnowSQL, cloud CLI tools.
   - **Open-source**: dbt, Apache NiFi, custom Python scripts.
   - **Specialized**: SnowConvert (code translation), AWS Schema Conversion Tool. 
   
   Choose based on: source system, automation needs, transformation complexity, budget.

## Advanced Topics

### 1. What is the Data Marketplace in Snowflake?
   - Platform for discovering and accessing third-party datasets directly in Snowflake. Providers share data (weather, financial, demographics) via secure data sharing. Consumers access instantly without ETL or copying. Free and paid datasets available. Use cases: data enrichment, market research, geospatial analytics. Query shared data directly in your account.

### 2. How do you access third-party data through the Marketplace?
   - Browse Marketplace in Web UI, search by category/provider, request access to datasets. Provider grants access, you create database from share: `CREATE DATABASE marketplace_db FROM SHARE provider.share_name`. Query immediately without data movement. Some require subscription or payment agreements. Data stays in provider's account.

### 3. What is Snowpark and how does it differ from traditional SQL?
   - Snowpark is DataFrame API for Python, Scala, Java enabling data engineering in familiar languages. Code executed server-side on Snowflake compute.
   - **vs SQL**: Programmatic flexibility, loops/conditionals, complex transformations, deploy custom logic as UDFs. Pushes computation to data (avoiding data movement). Used for ML pipelines, complex ETL, analytics workflows.

### 4. How do you run Python code in Snowflake using Snowpark?
   - Install snowflake-snowpark-python, create session: `session = Session.builder.configs(connection_params).create()`. Use DataFrames: `df = session.table('employees').filter(col('dept') == 'IT')`. Register UDFs: `@udf(...)`. Execute locally or deploy to Snowflake. Benefits: leverage Snowflake compute, avoid data transfer, integrate with Python ecosystem.

### 5. What are Snowflake's machine learning capabilities?
   - Snowpark ML for feature engineering and model training/deployment. Support for Python ML libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost) via UDFs. Cortex ML Functions (built-in): forecasting, anomaly detection, sentiment analysis. External function integration with SageMaker, Azure ML. Store models in stages, deploy as UDFs for scoring. Feature store capabilities in development.

### 6. What is the difference between Standard and Enterprise editions?
   - **Standard**: Basic features, 1-day Time Travel, single-cluster warehouses.
   - **Enterprise**: Multi-cluster warehouses, materialized views, up to 90-day Time Travel, column-level security, database replication/failover, search optimization. Enterprise adds advanced features for larger deployments. Price: ~2x Standard edition credits.

### 7. What features are available in Business Critical edition?
   - All Enterprise features plus: HIPAA/PCI compliance support, customer-managed encryption keys (Tri-Secret Secure), dedicated metadata store and pool, database failover/failback, enhanced data protection, SOC 1/2 Type II audits, support for PHI/PII workloads. Price: ~3x Standard. Required for regulated industries (healthcare, finance).

### 8. What is Private Connectivity (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link)?
   - Secure network connectivity bypassing public internet. Traffic stays within cloud provider network.
   - **AWS PrivateLink**: VPC endpoint to Snowflake.
   - **Azure Private Link**: Private endpoint in VNet. Benefits: enhanced security, regulatory compliance, reduced data egress costs, lower latency. Configure via Snowflake support, requires Business Critical edition.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. How do you troubleshoot slow queries?
   - Check Query Profile for bottlenecks: large TableScan (consider clustering), expensive joins (optimize join order), spilling to disk (increase warehouse size), high network transfer (reduce data movement). Verify partition pruning effectiveness. Check warehouse size appropriateness. Review for missing filters. Analyze bytes scanned vs returned ratio. Consider materialized views for repeated patterns.

### 2. What causes "Query compilation time is too high" errors?
   - Complex queries with many tables/joins, large IN lists, deeply nested subqueries, extensive view dependencies, or first-time schema access. Solutions: simplify query structure, break into smaller queries, use temp tables for intermediate results, ensure statistics are current, increase warehouse size. Compilation cached after first run, subsequent executions faster.

### 3. How do you debug data loading failures?
   - Check COPY command results for error messages, use VALIDATION_MODE to preview without loading, query LOAD_HISTORY for failure details, examine rejected rows via ON_ERROR settings, verify file format matches data, check stage file existence, validate credentials for external stages, review character encoding issues. Start with small sample file to isolate problem.

### 4. What causes "Out of Disk Space" errors?
   - Query result set too large for warehouse local storage, complex query spilling intermediate results to disk, insufficient warehouse size for workload. Solutions: increase warehouse size, reduce result set with filters/LIMIT, break query into smaller parts using temp tables, optimize joins to reduce intermediate data, consider materialized views for large aggregations.

### 5. How do you resolve authentication issues?
   - Verify username/password correctness, check account identifier format (account.region.cloud), ensure MFA enrollment if required, validate SSO configuration, check network policies for IP restrictions, verify user not locked or disabled, ensure role has necessary privileges, check password expiration. Review LOGIN_HISTORY for failure reasons.

### 6. What do you do if a warehouse is not starting?
   - Check warehouse state (suspended vs resumed), verify USAGE privilege on warehouse, ensure no resource monitor blocking, check account credit balance, verify warehouse size allowed in account, review error messages in Query History. Try suspending and resuming. Check for account-level issues or quota restrictions.

### 7. How do you handle schema evolution issues?
   - Streams become stale if schema changes significantly - recreate stream. External tables require refreshing metadata: `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH`. Views fail if dependent columns dropped - use TRY_CAST for robustness. Materialized views may need manual refresh on schema changes. Test schema changes in dev clone before production. Use ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN carefully with dependent objects.

## Best Practices

### 1. What are best practices for warehouse sizing?
   - Start with Small or Medium, monitor performance and adjust. Use separate warehouses for different workloads (ETL, reporting, ad-hoc). Scale up for faster single queries, scale out (multi-cluster) for concurrency. Enable auto-suspend (5-10 minutes) and auto-resume. Right-size based on actual usage patterns, not peak theoretical needs. Monitor with Query Profile and warehouse metrics.

### 2. How do you organize databases and schemas?
   - Organize by business domain or data source (SALES_DB, MARKETING_DB). Use schemas for logical separation (RAW, STAGING, ANALYTICS, REPORTING). Separate DEV, TEST, PROD environments using database clones or separate accounts. Create UTILITY schema for shared UDFs/procedures. Use consistent naming conventions. Apply appropriate retention policies per environment.

### 3. What are naming conventions recommendations?
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores (customer_orders, not CustomerOrders). Prefix objects by type or source (stg_customers for staging, dim_product for dimension). Avoid reserved words. Keep names under 255 characters. Use consistent patterns: fact_sales, dim_date. Document naming standards in team guidelines. Include environment indicators for non-production (dev_sales_db).

### 4. How do you implement a development, staging, and production environment?
   - **Option 1**: Separate databases (DEV_DB, STAGING_DB, PROD_DB) in same account.
   - **Option 2**: Separate Snowflake accounts for complete isolation. Use zero-copy cloning from PROD to lower environments for testing with real data. Implement role-based access per environment. Use CI/CD pipelines to promote code changes. Separate warehouses per environment to isolate costs.

### 5. What are best practices for role hierarchy design?
   - Follow principle of least privilege. Create functional roles (DATA_ENGINEER, ANALYST, BI_DEVELOPER). Use role hierarchies: functional roles â†’ SYSADMIN â†’ SECURITYADMIN/ACCOUNTADMIN. Avoid granting privileges directly to users (use roles). Limit ACCOUNTADMIN usage to critical admin tasks. Document role purposes. Regular access reviews. Use custom roles vs system roles for day-to-day work.

### 6. How do you implement CI/CD for Snowflake?
   - Version control DDL scripts in Git. Use tools: dbt, Flyway, Liquibase, Schemachange for migrations. Automate deployments via GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins. Test in dev/staging clones before production. Use service accounts for automation. Implement approval gates for production changes. Tag releases, maintain rollback scripts. Monitor deployments with automated testing.

### 7. What are best practices for query optimization?
   - Select only needed columns (avoid SELECT *), use WHERE filters early, leverage clustering on large tables, use appropriate data types, avoid DISTINCT on high-cardinality columns, optimize JOIN order (smaller tables first), use LIMIT for testing, leverage materialized views for complex aggregations, analyze Query Profile regularly, cache results by running identical queries.

### 8. How do you handle sensitive data (PII, PHI)?
   - Implement masking policies on PII columns, use row access policies for multi-tenant data, create secure views hiding sensitive logic, limit data access to necessary roles only, enable MFA for privileged users, use Tri-Secret Secure (Business Critical), audit access via ACCESS_HISTORY, implement data classification with tags, comply with data residency requirements, encrypt data end-to-end.

   - **Structure**: Databases - RAW_DB (source data), STAGING_DB (cleansed), ANALYTICS_DB (dimensional model), REPORTING_DB (aggregates).
   - **Schemas**: By source/domain (pos, ecommerce, inventory).
   - **Tables**: Fact tables (fact_sales, fact_inventory), dimensions (dim_product, dim_customer, dim_date, dim_store).
   - **Warehouses**: Separate for ETL (Large), reporting (Medium), ad-hoc (Small with auto-suspend).
   - **Features**: Clustering on date for facts, Time Travel for auditing, secure views for sensitive data, data sharing for vendor collaboration.

### 2. Describe a real-time data pipeline using Snowflake
   - External source (Kafka, SaaS) â†’ Cloud storage (S3/Azure) â†’ Snowpipe auto-ingest â†’ Raw table â†’ Stream captures changes â†’ Task processes stream (transformations) â†’ Analytics table â†’ BI dashboard. Configure Snowpipe with event notifications, create stream on raw table, schedule serverless task with WHEN condition checking SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA(), task performs MERGE into target using stream data, result available for real-time reporting within minutes.

### 3. How would you handle a slowly changing dimension (SCD Type 2) in Snowflake?
   - **Table design**: Add effective_date, end_date, is_current flag, version_number. Use surrogate key (not natural key) as primary key.
   - **Load process**: Compare incoming with current records, expire changed records (set end_date = current_date, is_current = FALSE), insert new records (effective_date = current_date, end_date = '9999-12-31', is_current = TRUE).
   - **Implementation**: Use MERGE statement or Stream+Task pattern.
   - **Query**: Join on surrogate key with date range filter for point-in-time accuracy.

### 4. How would you implement a data lake architecture using Snowflake?
   - **Bronze layer**: External tables on raw files in S3/Azure (Parquet/JSON), minimal transformation.
   - **Silver layer**: Snowflake tables with cleansed, conformed data loaded via Snowpipe or COPY.
   - **Gold layer**: Dimensional models, aggregated tables, materialized views for consumption.

   Use external stages for infrequent access, internal tables for performance. Implement with Tasks for orchestration, Streams for incremental processing, partitioned external tables for efficient scanning.

### 5. How would you optimize a dashboard that queries billions of rows?
   - Create materialized views for complex aggregations, implement clustering keys on filter columns (date, category), use search optimization for point lookups, pre-aggregate data in summary tables refreshed via Tasks, design star schema with proper fact/dimension separation, use dedicated warehouse for dashboard queries, enable result caching by consistent query patterns, limit date ranges with parameters, partition large facts by date, consider incremental refresh strategy.

### 6. How would you handle incremental data loading?
   - **Timestamp-based**: Track max timestamp, load records WHERE timestamp > last_load.
   - **CDC with Streams**: Create stream on source table, process delta changes.
   - **Merge pattern**: Use MERGE statement with source-target matching on business key.
   - **Watermark table**: Maintain high-water mark of last processed record.
   - **Change tracking**: Leverage source system CDC (database logs, change tables).
   
   Schedule via Tasks, validate row counts, handle late-arriving data, implement error handling and retry logic.

### 7. Describe how you would implement data quality checks in Snowflake
   - **Schema validation**: NOT NULL constraints, data type checks in COPY.
   - **Business rules**: Create Task running validation queries (null checks, referential integrity, duplicate detection, range validation).
   - **Anomaly detection**: Compare current load to historical patterns (row counts, value distributions).
   - **Data profiling**: Use INFORMATION_SCHEMA statistics, COUNT DISTINCT for cardinality.
   - **Logging**: Insert validation results to audit table.
   - **Alerts**: Resource Monitors or external notifications on failures.
