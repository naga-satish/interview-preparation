## Terraform Basics and Core Concepts

### 1. What is Terraform and what is its primary purpose?
   - Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that enables you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files
   - Primary purposes: provision resources across multiple cloud providers, manage infrastructure lifecycle, enable version control of infrastructure, and maintain consistency across environments

### 2. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
   - IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than through manual processes or interactive configuration tools
   - Benefits include version control, repeatability, consistency, automation, and collaboration

### 3. How does Terraform differ from other IaC tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet?
   - **Terraform**: Declarative, immutable infrastructure, focuses on provisioning, cloud-agnostic
   - **Ansible**: Primarily configuration management, imperative approach, agentless
   - **Chef/Puppet**: Configuration management tools, agent-based, focus on maintaining system state after provisioning

### 4. What are the key features of Terraform?
   - Multi-cloud support, declarative syntax (HCL), state management, execution plans, resource graphs, change automation, and extensive provider ecosystem

### 5. How do you install Terraform on different operating systems?
   - **macOS**: `brew install terraform` or download binary
   - **Linux**: Download binary, extract to `/usr/local/bin`, or use package managers
   - **Windows**: Download binary, add to PATH, or use Chocolatey: `choco install terraform`

### 6. What is HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)?
   - HCL is a structured configuration language designed to be human-readable and machine-friendly
   - Features: JSON-compatible, supports comments, variables, functions, and expressions
   - Designed specifically for describing infrastructure resources

### 7. What is the difference between declarative and imperative approaches in IaC?
   - **Declarative (Terraform)**: Describes the desired end state; the tool figures out how to achieve it
   - **Imperative**: Specifies the exact steps and commands to reach the desired state
   - Declarative is more maintainable and less error-prone

### 8. What are the benefits of using Terraform over manual infrastructure management?
   - Consistency and repeatability, version control, automation, collaboration, cost optimization, disaster recovery, documentation as code, and reduced human errors

## Terraform Architecture and Components

### 1. What are Terraform providers and how do they work?
   - Providers are plugins that enable Terraform to interact with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and APIs
   - They translate Terraform configuration into API calls to the target platform
   - Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker
   - Providers are downloaded automatically during `terraform init`

### 2. What are Terraform modules and why are they important?
   - Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together
   - They enable code reusability, organization, encapsulation, and standardization
   - Types: Root module (main working directory) and child modules (called by other modules)

### 3. What is the Terraform core workflow?
   - **Write**: Define infrastructure in configuration files
   - **Plan**: Review changes before applying (`terraform plan`)
   - **Apply**: Provision infrastructure (`terraform apply`)
   - Additional steps: Initialize (`terraform init`), Validate (`terraform validate`)

### 4. What are resources in Terraform?
   - Resources are the most important element in Terraform language
   - They describe one or more infrastructure objects (VMs, networks, DNS records)
   - Syntax: `resource "resource_type" "resource_name" { configuration }`

### 5. What are data sources in Terraform?
   - Data sources allow Terraform to fetch information from external sources
   - They provide read-only access to existing infrastructure
   - Syntax: `data "data_source_type" "data_source_name" { configuration }`
   - Used to reference resources not managed by current Terraform configuration

### 6. What is the difference between provider and provisioner in Terraform?
   - **Provider**: Interface to APIs for creating/managing resources (AWS, Azure, etc.)
   - **Provisioner**: Execute scripts or commands on local/remote machines after resource creation
   - Provisioners are generally discouraged; prefer cloud-init or configuration management tools

### 7. How does Terraform interact with cloud providers?
   - Through provider plugins that translate HCL configuration into API calls
   - Uses authentication methods (credentials, service principals, IAM roles)
   - Maintains state to track resource relationships and metadata

### 8. What are Terraform backends?
   - Backends determine where Terraform state is stored and how operations are executed
   - Types: Local (default), Remote (S3, Azure Storage, GCS, Consul, etc.)
   - Enable state locking, team collaboration, and enhanced security

## Terraform State Management

### 1. What is Terraform state and why is it important?
   - State is a JSON file that maps real-world resources to Terraform configuration
   - Tracks resource metadata, dependencies, and current configuration
   - Essential for: performance optimization, tracking resource relationships, detecting drift, and determining what changes to apply

### 2. Where is the Terraform state file stored by default?
   - Stored locally in `terraform.tfstate` file in the working directory
   - Also creates `terraform.tfstate.backup` for backup purposes
   - Default local storage is not suitable for team environments

### 3. What is remote state and why should you use it?
   - Remote state stores the state file in a shared location (S3, Azure Storage, GCS)
   - Benefits: team collaboration, state locking, encryption at rest, versioning, and centralized management
   - Prevents conflicts and ensures consistency across team members

### 4. How do you manage Terraform state in a team environment?
   - Use remote backends with state locking (S3 + DynamoDB, Azure Storage + Blob lease)
   - Implement proper access controls and encryption
   - Use consistent Terraform versions across team
   - Establish workflows for state management and conflict resolution

### 5. What is state locking and why is it necessary?
   - State locking prevents concurrent operations that could corrupt the state
   - Ensures only one person can modify infrastructure at a time
   - Implemented automatically with compatible backends (DynamoDB for S3, native support in Terraform Cloud)

### 6. How do you import existing infrastructure into Terraform state?
   - Use `terraform import <resource_address> <resource_id>` command
   - Write corresponding configuration before importing
   - Verify import with `terraform plan` to ensure no changes are detected

### 7. What happens if the state file is deleted or corrupted?
   - Terraform loses track of managed resources
   - Resources become "orphaned" and won't be managed
   - Recovery options: restore from backup, recreate state file, or use `terraform import`
   - May require manual cleanup of actual resources

### 8. How do you handle sensitive data in Terraform state files?
   - Use remote backends with encryption at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper access controls and audit logging
   - Consider using external secret management systems
   - Mark sensitive variables appropriately in configuration

### 9. What is the purpose of terraform refresh command?
   - Updates the state file with the real-world status of resources
   - Detects drift between actual infrastructure and state
   - Now deprecated in favor of `terraform plan -refresh-only` and `terraform apply -refresh-only`

### 10. How do you migrate Terraform state from local to remote backend?
    - Configure the new backend in your configuration
    - Run `terraform init` and confirm migration when prompted
    - Verify state integrity after migration
    - Remove local state files after successful migration

## Terraform Commands and Workflow

   - Allows review before making actual changes (dry-run)

### 3. What does terraform apply do?
   - Executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan
   - Creates, updates, or deletes infrastructure resources
   - Updates the state file to reflect changes
   - Can accept a saved plan file or generate a new plan

### 4. How does terraform destroy work?
   - Destroys all resources managed by the Terraform configuration
   - Creates a destruction plan and prompts for confirmation
   - Updates state file to remove destroyed resources
   - Use `terraform destroy -target` for selective destruction

### 5. What is the difference between terraform validate and terraform fmt?
   - **terraform validate**: Checks configuration syntax and internal consistency
   - **terraform fmt**: Formats configuration files to canonical style
   - Validate focuses on correctness; fmt focuses on code style and readability

### 6. What is terraform output used for?
   - Extracts and displays output values from Terraform state

    - **terraform state rm**: Removes resources from state
    - **terraform state pull/push**: Downloads/uploads state

## Terraform Configuration and Syntax

### 1. How do you define variables in Terraform?
   - Use `variable` blocks to define input variables
   - Variables can have type constraints, default values, and descriptions
   - Types: string, number, bool, list, map, set, object, tuple
   ```hcl
   variable "instance_type" {
     description = "EC2 instance type"
     type        = string
     default     = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

### 2. What are the different ways to pass variable values in Terraform?
   - Command line: `-var="key=value"`
   - Variable files: `-var-file="filename"` or `terraform.tfvars`
   - Environment variables: `TF_VAR_variable_name`
   - Default values in variable declarations
   - Interactive prompts for undefined variables

### 3. What are output values in Terraform?
   - Output values expose information about infrastructure for external consumption
   - Used for debugging, integration with other tools, or sharing data between configurations
   ```hcl
   output "instance_ip" {
     description = "The public IP of the instance"
     value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
   }
   ```

### 4. How do you use locals in Terraform?
   - Local values assign names to expressions for reuse within a module
   - Help avoid repetition and make configurations more readable
   ```hcl
   locals {
     common_tags = {
       Environment = "production"
       Project     = "web-app"
     }
   }
   ```

### 5. What are count and for_each meta-arguments?
   - **count**: Creates multiple instances using numeric indexing
   - **for_each**: Creates instances for each item in a map or set
   - for_each is preferred as it provides stable resource addresses
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     for_each = var.instance_names
     # configuration
   }
   ```

### 6. How do you implement conditional logic in Terraform?
   - Use conditional expressions: `condition ? true_val : false_val`
   - Combine with count or for_each for conditional resource creation
   ```hcl
   count = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0
   ```

### 7. What are dynamic blocks in Terraform?
   - Dynamic blocks generate nested configuration blocks based on complex values
   - Useful for creating multiple similar nested blocks
   ```hcl
   dynamic "ingress" {
     for_each = var.ingress_rules
     content {
       from_port = ingress.value.from_port
       to_port   = ingress.value.to_port
     }
   }
   ```

### 8. How do you use functions in Terraform?
   - Terraform provides built-in functions for string manipulation, collection operations, date/time, etc.
   - Examples: `length()`, `merge()`, `format()`, `file()`, `lookup()`
   - Functions cannot be user-defined; only built-in functions are available

### 9. What is interpolation in Terraform?
   - Legacy syntax for embedding expressions within strings using `${...}`
   - Modern Terraform uses direct expression syntax without interpolation
   - Still required in certain contexts like backends and provider configurations

### 10. How do you reference resources in Terraform?
    - Use resource references: `resource_type.resource_name.attribute`
    - Data source references: `data.data_source_type.data_source_name.attribute`
    - Variable references: `var.variable_name`
    - Local references: `local.local_name`

## Terraform Modules

### 1. What are Terraform modules and when should you use them?
   - Modules are containers for multiple resources used together as a group
   - Use cases: code reusability, organization, standardization, encapsulation
   - When to use: complex infrastructure patterns, multi-environment deployments, team collaboration

### 2. How do you create a reusable Terraform module?
   - Create a directory with `.tf` files containing resource definitions
   - Define input variables for customization
   - Provide output values for external consumption
   - Include documentation and examples
   - Follow semantic versioning for module releases

### 3. What is the difference between root module and child module?
   - **Root module**: The main working directory where Terraform commands are run
   - **Child module**: A module called by another module using `module` blocks
   - Root module can call multiple child modules; child modules can call other modules

### 4. How do you pass variables to modules?
   - Use arguments in the module block
   - Arguments correspond to input variables defined in the child module
   ```hcl
   module "vpc" {
     source = "./modules/vpc"
     cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
     environment = "production"
   }
   ```

### 5. How do you reference module outputs?
   - Use syntax: `module.module_name.output_name`
   - Module must define output values to be accessible
   - Useful for passing data between modules or to root module outputs

### 6. What are public modules in the Terraform Registry?
   - Pre-built modules available in the Terraform Registry
   - Community-contributed and verified modules
   - Referenced using registry syntax: `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`
   - Provide tested, documented solutions for common infrastructure patterns

### 7. How do you version control Terraform modules?
   - Use Git tags for versioning: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`
   - Reference specific versions in module sources
   - Follow semantic versioning principles
   - Maintain compatibility and document breaking changes

### 8. What are module sources in Terraform?
   - Local paths: `./modules/vpc`
   - Git repositories: `git::https://github.com/user/repo.git`
   - Terraform Registry: `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`

   - Separate modules directory: `modules/vpc/`, `modules/compute/`
   - Use consistent naming conventions and documentation
   - Implement proper dependency management between modules

### 10. What are the best practices for module design?
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Clear and consistent input/output interfaces
    - Comprehensive documentation and examples
    - Version control and semantic versioning
    - Minimize external dependencies and avoid hardcoded values

## Terraform Providers and Provider Configuration

### 1. How do you configure a provider in Terraform?
   - Use `provider` blocks to configure provider settings
   - Specify version constraints, authentication, and region/location
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region  = "us-west-2"
     version = "~> 4.0"
   }
   ```

### 2. What is provider versioning and why is it important?
   - Provider versioning ensures compatibility and reproducible deployments
   - Use version constraints to prevent breaking changes: `~>`, `>=`, `=`
   - Important for stability, security updates, and team consistency
   - Locked versions are stored in `.terraform.lock.hcl`

### 3. How do you use multiple provider instances?
   - Use provider aliases to create multiple configurations
   - Useful for multi-region deployments or different accounts
   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     alias  = "us-east-1"
     region = "us-east-1"
   }
   ```

### 4. What are provider aliases?
   - Named alternative provider configurations within the same provider type
   - Referenced in resources using the `provider` meta-argument
   - Enable management of resources across multiple regions or accounts

### 5. How do you authenticate with cloud providers in Terraform?
   - **AWS**: IAM roles, access keys, profiles, instance profiles
   - **Azure**: Service principals, managed identity, Azure CLI
   - **GCP**: Service accounts, Application Default Credentials
   - Best practice: Use IAM roles or managed identities rather than static credentials

### 6. What is the provider dependency lock file?
   - `.terraform.lock.hcl` file that locks provider versions and checksums
   - Ensures consistent provider versions across team members
   - Created/updated during `terraform init`
   - Should be committed to version control

### 7. How do you upgrade provider versions?
   - Update version constraints in configuration
   - Run `terraform init -upgrade` to upgrade to newer versions
   - Review provider changelogs for breaking changes
   - Test thoroughly before applying to production

### 8. What happens if you don't specify a provider version?
   - Terraform downloads the latest available version during `terraform init`
   - Can lead to unexpected breaking changes and inconsistent behavior
   - Provider versions become locked after first download
   - Best practice: Always specify version constraints

## Terraform Workspaces

### 1. What are Terraform workspaces?
   - Named instances of Terraform state within the same configuration
   - Allow multiple deployments of the same infrastructure configuration
   - Each workspace maintains its own state file
   - Default workspace is named "default"

### 2. When should you use workspaces versus separate state files?
   - **Use workspaces**: Simple environment variations (dev/staging/prod) with minimal differences
   - **Use separate state files**: Complex environments, different teams, security boundaries, or significantly different configurations
   - Workspaces share the same backend configuration

### 3. How do you create and switch between workspaces?
   - Create: `terraform workspace new <workspace_name>`
   - List: `terraform workspace list`
   - Switch: `terraform workspace select <workspace_name>`
   - Show current: `terraform workspace show`
   - Delete: `terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>`

### 4. What are the limitations of Terraform workspaces?
   - All workspaces share the same backend configuration
   - Limited isolation (same access permissions)
   - Not suitable for completely different environments
   - CLI-only feature (not available in Terraform Cloud/Enterprise)
   - State files stored in same backend location

### 5. How do you reference the current workspace in configuration?
   - Use `terraform.workspace` to get the current workspace name
   - Useful for conditional logic and resource naming
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     instance_type = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "m5.large" : "t2.micro"
     tags = {
       Environment = terraform.workspace
     }
   }
   ```

## Terraform Backends and Remote State

### 1. What are Terraform backends?
   - Backends determine where Terraform state is stored and how operations are performed
   - Define how state is loaded and how operations like apply are executed
   - Can be local (default) or remote (S3, Azure Storage, GCS, Consul, etc.)
   - Enable features like state locking, encryption, and team collaboration

### 2. What is the difference between local and remote backends?
   - **Local backend**: State stored on local filesystem (`terraform.tfstate`)
   - **Remote backend**: State stored in external systems with additional features
   - Remote backends provide: state locking, encryption, versioning, team collaboration, and centralized management

### 3. How do you configure S3 as a backend for Terraform?
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
       key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
       region         = "us-west-2"
       dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
       encrypt        = true
     }
   }
   ```

### 4. What is state locking in DynamoDB when using S3 backend?
   - DynamoDB table provides distributed locking mechanism for S3 backend
   - Prevents concurrent modifications to the same state file
   - Table must have primary key named "LockID" (String type)
   - Automatically managed by Terraform during operations

### 5. How do you share state data between configurations using terraform_remote_state?
   - Use `terraform_remote_state` data source to read outputs from another state file
   - Enables loose coupling between different Terraform configurations
   ```hcl
   data "terraform_remote_state" "vpc" {
     backend = "s3"
     config = {
       bucket = "my-terraform-state"
       key    = "vpc/terraform.tfstate"
       region = "us-west-2"
     }
   }
   ```

### 6. What are the benefits of using remote state?
   - Team collaboration and concurrent access control
   - State locking to prevent conflicts
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Versioning and backup capabilities
   - Centralized state management
   - Enhanced security and access controls

### 7. How do you migrate from one backend to another?
   - Update backend configuration in Terraform files
   - Run `terraform init` and confirm migration when prompted
   - Terraform copies state from old backend to new backend
   - Verify migration success with `terraform plan`
   - Clean up old backend location if migration successful

## Terraform Best Practices

    - Use testing frameworks like Terratest for integration testing
    - Implement static analysis tools (tfsec, checkov)
    - Use staging environments for testing before production

## Advanced Terraform Concepts

### 1. How do you implement infrastructure testing in Terraform?
   - **Static analysis**: Use tools like tfsec, checkov for security scanning
   - **Unit testing**: Test modules in isolation with different input combinations
   - **Integration testing**: Use Terratest to deploy and validate real infrastructure
   - **Compliance testing**: Implement policy-as-code with tools like Sentinel or OPA
   - **Continuous testing**: Integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines

### 2. What is terraform validate used for?
   - Validates configuration syntax and internal consistency
   - Checks for required arguments and proper resource references
   - Validates variable types and constraints
   - Does not access remote state or validate provider-specific logic
   - Should be run as part of development workflow and CI/CD

### 3. How do you use terraform console for debugging?
   - Interactive console for evaluating Terraform expressions
   - Test functions, variables, and resource references
   - Debug complex expressions and interpolations
   - Access: `terraform console` from initialized directory
   - Useful for troubleshooting configuration issues

### 4. What are provisioners and when should you avoid them?
   - Provisioners execute scripts on local or remote machines after resource creation
   - Types: local-exec, remote-exec, file provisioner
   - **Avoid because**: violate immutable infrastructure principles, harder to maintain, error-prone
   - **Alternatives**: cloud-init, configuration management tools, custom AMIs/images

### 5. What is the null_resource in Terraform?
   - Resource that doesn't correspond to any real infrastructure
   - Useful for running provisioners or creating dependencies
