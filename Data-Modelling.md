## Fundamentals of Data Modeling

### 1. What is data modeling and why is it important in data engineering?
Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of data structures, relationships, and constraints within a system. It defines how data is stored, organized, and accessed. Importance: ensures data consistency, improves query performance, facilitates communication between technical and business teams, supports data integrity, and provides a blueprint for database implementation.

### 2. What are the three types of data models (conceptual, logical, and physical)?
- **Conceptual:** High-level business view showing entities and relationships without technical details
- **Logical:** Detailed structure with attributes, data types, and relationships, independent of database technology
- **Physical:** Implementation-specific model with tables, columns, indexes, and storage details for a particular DBMS

### 3. What is the difference between a conceptual, logical, and physical data model?
- **Conceptual:** Focuses on business entities (e.g., Customer, Order); used for stakeholder communication
- **Logical:** Adds attributes, primary keys, and relationships; defines normalization; database-agnostic
- **Physical:** Includes implementation details like data types, indexes, partitions, constraints; specific to database platform

### 4. What is a table and what are its key components?
A table is a collection of related data organized in rows and columns. Key components: columns (attributes/fields defining data type and constraints), rows (records/tuples containing actual data), primary key (unique identifier), foreign keys (relationships), constraints (rules for data integrity), and indexes (performance optimization).

### 5. What is an entity and what is an attribute?
An **entity** is a real-world object or concept that can be distinctly identified (e.g., Customer, Product, Order). An **attribute** is a property or characteristic of an entity (e.g., Customer entity has attributes like customer_id, name, email, phone).

### 6. What is a primary key and why is it important?
A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Importance: ensures data uniqueness, prevents duplicate records, enables efficient data retrieval, establishes relationships between tables, and serves as the main reference point for foreign keys. Must be unique, not null, and ideally immutable.

### 7. What is a foreign key and how does it establish relationships?
A foreign key is a column that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between two tables. It enforces referential integrity by ensuring values in the foreign key column exist in the referenced table's primary key. 

**Example:** `order.customer_id` (FK) references `customer.customer_id` (PK).

### 8. What is a composite key?
A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns that together uniquely identify a row. Used when no single column can guarantee uniqueness. Example: In an enrollment table, `(student_id, course_id)` together form a composite key since a student can enroll in multiple courses and a course can have multiple students.

### 9. What is a surrogate key and when would you use it?
A surrogate key is an artificial identifier (usually auto-incremented integer or UUID) with no business meaning, used as the primary key. Use when: natural keys are complex or unstable, need to simplify joins, want to hide sensitive information, or ensure immutability. Example: `customer_id` (1, 2, 3...) instead of using email as the key.

### 10. What is a natural key vs. a surrogate key?
- **Natural Key:** Exists in the real world with business meaning (e.g., SSN, email, ISBN). Pros: meaningful to users. Cons: may change, can be composite, privacy concerns.
- **Surrogate Key:** System-generated with no business meaning (e.g., auto-increment ID). Pros: stable, simple, fast joins. Cons: no inherent meaning, requires additional column.

## Normalization and Denormalization

### 1. What is normalization and why is it used?
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables. Purpose: eliminates duplicate data, reduces storage costs, prevents update anomalies, ensures data consistency, and simplifies data maintenance. Achieved through applying normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).

### 2. Explain the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)?
- **1NF:** Atomic values, no repeating groups, each column has unique name
- **2NF:** 1NF + no partial dependencies (all non-key attributes fully depend on the entire primary key)
- **3NF:** 2NF + no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on primary key, not on other non-key attributes)
- **BCNF:** Stricter 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key

### 3. What is First Normal Form (1NF)?
A table is in 1NF if: (1) all columns contain atomic (indivisible) values, (2) each column contains values of a single type, (3) each column has a unique name, (4) the order of rows doesn't matter. Violation example: storing multiple phone numbers in one column as "123-456, 789-012". Solution: create separate rows or a related phone table.

### 4. What is Second Normal Form (2NF)?
A table is in 2NF if: (1) it's in 1NF, and (2) all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the entire primary key (no partial dependencies). Relevant only for tables with composite keys. Example violation: In `(student_id, course_id, student_name, grade)`, student_name depends only on student_id, not the full composite key. Solution: separate student data into its own table.

### 5. What is Third Normal Form (3NF)?
A table is in 3NF if: (1) it's in 2NF, and (2) no transitive dependencies exist (non-key attributes don't depend on other non-key attributes). Example violation: `(employee_id, department_id, department_name)` where department_name depends on department_id, not employee_id. Solution: create separate department table.

### 6. What is Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)?
A stricter version of 3NF. A table is in BCNF if: for every functional dependency X → Y, X must be a super key. Addresses scenarios where 3NF still has anomalies due to overlapping candidate keys. Most tables in 3NF are also in BCNF, but BCNF eliminates all redundancy based on functional dependencies.

### 7. What is denormalization and when would you use it?
Denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy by merging tables or adding duplicate data to improve read performance. Use when: query performance is critical, read-heavy workloads, complex joins slow down queries, data warehousing/OLAP systems, or when data updates are infrequent. Trade-off: faster reads but slower writes and potential data inconsistency.

### 8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of normalization?
- **Advantages:** Eliminates redundancy, prevents update/insert/delete anomalies, reduces storage, improves data integrity, easier maintenance.
- **Disadvantages:** Complex queries with multiple joins, slower read performance, more tables to manage, increased query complexity, potential for over-normalization.

### 9. What are the advantages and disadvantages of denormalization?
- **Advantages:** Faster query performance, fewer joins, simpler queries, better for reporting/analytics, reduced I/O operations.
- **Disadvantages:** Data redundancy, increased storage, update anomalies risk, complex update logic, data inconsistency potential, more difficult maintenance.

### 10. How do you decide between normalization and denormalization for a project?

Consider the following factors:

1) **Workload type:** OLTP systems favor normalization, OLAP/analytics favor denormalization.
2) **Read vs write ratio:** High reads → denormalize, high writes → normalize.
3) **Performance requirements:** Critical query speed → denormalize.
4) **Data consistency needs:** Strict consistency → normalize.
5) **Storage costs:** Limited storage → normalize.
6) **Query complexity:** Start normalized, selectively denormalize based on performance bottlenecks.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling

### 1. What is an Entity-Relationship (ER) model?
An ER model is a conceptual framework that represents data structure using entities, attributes, and relationships. It provides a visual diagram (ERD) showing how business entities relate to each other. Used in database design to communicate structure to stakeholders and guide logical/physical model creation.

### 2. What are the main components of an ER model?

1) **Entities:** Objects or concepts (rectangles in ERD)
2) **Attributes:** Properties of entities (ovals)
3) **Relationships:** Associations between entities (diamonds)
4) **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers (underlined)
5) **Cardinality:** Relationship ratios (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
6) **Participation:** Whether entity participation is mandatory or optional.

### 3. What is an entity in ER modeling?
An entity is a distinguishable real-world object or concept that can be represented in a database. 

Types: 
1. **Strong entity:** Independent existence with its own primary key (e.g., Customer)
2. **Weak entity:** Depends on another entity for identification (e.g., OrderItem depends on Order). Represented as rectangles in ERDs.

### 4. What is a relationship in ER modeling?
A relationship defines an association between two or more entities. Example: Customer "places" Order, Employee "works in" Department. Relationships have cardinality (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and can have attributes of their own (e.g., enrollment_date in Student-Course relationship).

### 5. What are the different types of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)?
- **One-to-One (1:1):** One entity instance relates to exactly one instance of another (e.g., Employee-ParkingSpace)
- **One-to-Many (1:N):** One entity instance relates to multiple instances of another (e.g., Customer-Orders)
- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple instances relate to multiple instances (e.g., Students-Courses)

### 6. How do you represent a one-to-one relationship?
Place a foreign key in either table referencing the other's primary key, typically with a unique constraint. Example: Employee table has `parking_space_id` (unique FK) referencing ParkingSpace table. Choose the table where the relationship is mandatory or more frequently accessed.

### 7. How do you represent a one-to-many relationship?
Place a foreign key in the "many" side table referencing the "one" side's primary key. Example: Order table has `customer_id` FK referencing Customer table's primary key. One customer can have many orders, but each order belongs to one customer.

### 8. How do you represent a many-to-many relationship?
Create a junction/bridge table with foreign keys to both related tables. The junction table's primary key is typically a composite of both FKs. Example: Student-Course M:N relationship requires an Enrollment table with `(student_id, course_id)` as composite PK, plus optional attributes like enrollment_date, grade.

### 9. What is cardinality in ER modeling?
Cardinality defines the numerical relationship between entity instances. Expressed as minimum and maximum values (e.g., 0..*, 1..1, 1..*). Example: Customer (1) to Order (0..*) means one customer can have zero or many orders. Helps determine how foreign keys are implemented and whether they allow NULL values.

### 10. What is an associative entity or junction table?
An associative entity resolves many-to-many relationships by creating an intermediate table that contains foreign keys to both related entities. Often includes additional attributes about the relationship. Example: StudentCourse table with student_id, course_id, enrollment_date, grade connects Student and Course entities.

### 11. How do you handle a many-to-many relationship in a database?
Decompose it into two one-to-many relationships using a junction table. Steps: (1) Create junction table, (2) Add foreign keys referencing both parent tables, (3) Create composite primary key from both FKs or use surrogate key, (4) Add relationship-specific attributes if needed. Example: Author-Book M:N becomes Author 1:N BookAuthor N:1 Book.

### 12. What is a weak entity and strong entity?
- **Strong entity:** Has independent existence with its own primary key (e.g., Customer with customer_id)
- **Weak entity:** Cannot exist without a parent entity; uses parent's key plus partial key for identification (e.g., OrderItem needs order_id + line_number). Represented with double rectangles in ERDs.

### 13. How do you use UML in data modeling?
UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams can represent data models with classes as entities, attributes as properties, and associations as relationships. Shows cardinality using notations like 1, 0..1, 0..*, 1..*. Useful for object-relational mapping and communicating with software developers. More common in object-oriented design than traditional database modeling.

## Dimensional Modeling

### 1. What is dimensional modeling?
Dimensional modeling is a design technique optimized for data warehousing and analytics, organizing data into facts (measurements) and dimensions (context). Created by Ralph Kimball, it uses denormalized structures for fast query performance. Primary structures: star schema and snowflake schema. Optimized for OLAP queries, reporting, and business intelligence.

### 2. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP systems?
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):** Handles daily operations, normalized design, many small transactions, write-heavy, current data, row-oriented storage. Example: e-commerce order processing.
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):** Handles analytics/reporting, denormalized design, complex queries, read-heavy, historical data, column-oriented storage. Example: sales analysis dashboard.

### 3. What is a fact table?
A fact table stores quantitative measurements (facts/metrics) for business events and contains foreign keys to dimension tables. Characteristics: many rows, narrow (few columns), contains numeric measures and dimension FKs, grain defines detail level. Example: Sales fact with measures like revenue, quantity, discount and FKs to date, product, customer, store dimensions.

### 4. What is a dimension table?
A dimension table provides descriptive context for facts, containing textual/categorical attributes used for filtering, grouping, and labeling. Characteristics: fewer rows, wide (many columns), denormalized for query performance. Example: Product dimension with product_id, name, category, brand, color, size. Supports drill-down, roll-up, and slice-and-dice analysis.

### 5. What is the difference between a fact table and a dimension table?
- **Fact:** Numeric measurements, many rows, foreign keys to dimensions, additive metrics, time-variant, narrow. Example: sales_amount, quantity_sold
- **Dimension:** Descriptive attributes, fewer rows, provides context, textual data, slowly changing, wide. Example: product_name, customer_address

### 6. What is a star schema?
A star schema has a central fact table connected directly to denormalized dimension tables, forming a star shape. Dimensions are not normalized. Advantages: simple queries, fast performance, easy to understand. Disadvantages: data redundancy in dimensions, larger dimension tables. Best for: straightforward reporting with moderate dimension sizes.

### 7. What is a snowflake schema?
A snowflake schema normalizes dimension tables into multiple related tables, reducing redundancy. Example: Product dimension split into Product → Category → Department. Advantages: reduces storage, eliminates redundancy. Disadvantages: more complex queries with additional joins, slower performance. Best for: large dimensions with significant redundancy.

### 8. What is the difference between a star schema and a snowflake schema?
- **Star:** Denormalized dimensions, fewer joins, faster queries, more storage, simpler structure
- **Snowflake:** Normalized dimensions, more joins, slower queries, less storage, complex structure
Choice depends on query performance needs vs. storage optimization.

### 9. What is a galaxy schema (fact constellation)?
A galaxy schema contains multiple fact tables sharing common dimension tables. Used when multiple business processes need to be analyzed together. Example: Sales fact and Inventory fact both connect to Product, Date, and Store dimensions. Allows cross-process analysis but increases complexity.

### 10. What are measures in a fact table?
Measures are numeric values representing business metrics stored in fact tables. Types include: revenue, quantity, cost, profit, counts, durations. Organized by grain (detail level) and classified as additive, semi-additive, or non-additive based on how they can be aggregated.

### 11. What are additive, semi-additive, and non-additive measures?
- **Additive:** Can sum across all dimensions (e.g., sales_amount, quantity). Most flexible.
- **Semi-additive:** Can sum across some dimensions but not all (e.g., account_balance - can't sum across time). Common with snapshots.
- **Non-additive:** Cannot sum across any dimension (e.g., ratios, percentages, unit_price). Require recalculation.

### 12. What is a degenerate dimension?
A degenerate dimension is a dimension key stored in the fact table without a corresponding dimension table. Typically operational identifiers like order_number, invoice_number, ticket_number. Useful for tracking transactions but has no descriptive attributes warranting a separate dimension table.

### 13. What is a conformed dimension?
A conformed dimension is shared across multiple fact tables with consistent structure, meaning, and values. Ensures consistent analysis across business processes. Example: Date dimension used by Sales, Inventory, and Returns facts. Enables drill-across reporting and maintains enterprise-wide consistency.

### 14. What is a junk dimension?
A junk dimension combines multiple low-cardinality flags and indicators into a single dimension to avoid cluttering the fact table. Example: combining payment_type, shipping_method, gift_wrap_flag into a Transaction_Type dimension. Reduces fact table width and improves manageability.

### 15. What is a role-playing dimension?
A role-playing dimension is a single physical dimension used multiple times in a fact table with different contexts/meanings. Example: Date dimension used as order_date, ship_date, delivery_date. Implemented using views or aliases to provide meaningful names for each role while maintaining single source of truth.

## Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

### 1. What are Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)?
SCDs are dimension tables where attribute values change over time. SCD strategies determine how to track and manage these changes while maintaining historical accuracy. Common in data warehousing for tracking customer addresses, product prices, employee departments, etc. Different types (0-6) balance historical tracking needs vs. complexity.

### 2. What is SCD Type 0?
SCD Type 0 retains original values and never allows updates. Once a record is inserted, it remains unchanged forever. Use case: immutable attributes like date of birth, original hire date, or any historical fact that shouldn't change. Simplest approach with no historical tracking mechanism needed.

### 3. What is SCD Type 1 and when would you use it?
SCD Type 1 overwrites old values with new values, maintaining no history. When customer moves, old address is replaced with new one. Use when: history not needed, only current state matters, storage is limited, or changes are corrections rather than true changes. Simple but loses historical context.

### 4. What is SCD Type 2 and when would you use it?
SCD Type 2 creates a new record for each change, preserving full history. Uses effective dates (valid_from, valid_to) and/or version numbers plus a current_flag. Use when: full history required, regulatory compliance, audit trails needed, analyzing historical trends. Most common SCD type but increases dimension size.

Example structure:
```
+--------------|-------------|------|---------|------------|-----------|--------------+
| customer_key | customer_id | name | address | valid_from | valid_to  | current_flag |
+--------------|-------------|------|---------|------------|-----------|--------------+
| 1            | 101         | John | NYC     | 2020-01-01 | 2023-05-31| N            |
| 2            | 101         | John | LA      | 2023-06-01 | 9999-12-31| Y            |
+--------------|-------------|------|---------|------------|-----------|--------------+
```

### 5. What is SCD Type 3 and when would you use it?
SCD Type 3 adds columns to track limited history (e.g., previous_value and current_value columns). Only stores one level of history. Use when: tracking only one prior value, limited history sufficient, want to compare current vs. previous state. Example: current_address and previous_address columns.

### 6. How do you implement SCD Type 2 in practice?
1. Add surrogate key (not natural key) as primary key
2. Include valid_from, valid_to dates and current_flag
3. On update: set existing record's valid_to = today, current_flag = 'N'
4. Insert new record with valid_from = today, valid_to = '9999-12-31', current_flag = 'Y'
5. Fact tables reference surrogate key to maintain point-in-time accuracy

### 7. What are the key columns needed for SCD Type 2?
- **Surrogate Key:** Auto-generated primary key (e.g., customer_key)
- **Natural Key:** Business identifier (e.g., customer_id)
- **Attribute Columns:** Data being tracked
- **valid_from / effective_from:** When record became active
- **valid_to / effective_to:** When record became inactive (9999-12-31 for current)
- **current_flag / is_current:** Boolean indicating active record (Y/N or 1/0)
- **version_number:** Optional sequential version identifier

### 8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each SCD type?
- **Type 0:** Simple, guaranteed immutability | No flexibility for corrections
- **Type 1:** Simple, minimal storage | No history, data loss
- **Type 2:** Full history, point-in-time accuracy | Large tables, complex queries, duplicate natural keys
- **Type 3:** Limited history, simple queries | Only one prior value, inflexible

### 9. How do you handle slowly changing dimensions in a fact table?
Use surrogate keys from dimension tables as foreign keys in fact tables. This ensures facts point to the correct dimension version that was active when the transaction occurred. When querying, join on surrogate key with date filters on dimension's effective dates to get point-in-time accuracy. Never use natural keys as foreign keys in Type 2 scenarios.

## Data Warehouse Modeling

### 1. What is a data warehouse?
A data warehouse is a centralized repository that stores integrated, historical data from multiple sources, optimized for analysis and reporting. Characteristics: subject-oriented (organized by business area), integrated (consistent format), time-variant (historical tracking), non-volatile (read-mostly). Used for business intelligence, analytics, and decision-making.

### 2. What is the difference between a database and a data warehouse?
- **Database (OLTP):** Handles transactions, normalized, current data, write-optimized, supports daily operations, detailed granular data
- **Data Warehouse (OLAP):** Handles analytics, denormalized, historical data, read-optimized, supports decision-making, aggregated/summarized data

### 3. What is ETL in the context of data warehousing?
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is the process of moving data into a warehouse:
- **Extract:** Retrieve data from source systems (databases, APIs, files)
- **Transform:** Cleanse, validate, format, aggregate, and apply business rules
- **Load:** Insert processed data into target warehouse
Traditional approach where transformation happens before loading into warehouse.

### 4. What is ELT and how does it differ from ETL?
ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) loads raw data first, then transforms within the warehouse. 

**Differences:** ETL transforms outside warehouse (separate servers), ELT uses warehouse compute power for transformation. ELT better for cloud warehouses with elastic compute (Snowflake, BigQuery), preserves raw data, enables schema-on-read. ETL better for complex transformations, sensitive data masking before loading.

### 5. What is a data mart?
A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a specific business function, department, or subject area (e.g., Sales mart, Marketing mart). Characteristics: smaller scope, faster queries, easier to manage, tailored to specific user needs. Can be dependent (sourced from warehouse) or independent (sourced directly from operational systems).

### 6. What is the difference between a data warehouse and a data mart?
- **Data Warehouse:** Enterprise-wide, multiple subject areas, centralized, larger scale, source for data marts, strategic
- **Data Mart:** Department/function-specific, single subject area, decentralized, smaller scale, subset of warehouse, tactical
Data marts often provide better performance for specific use cases.

### 7. What is the Kimball methodology?
Kimball (bottom-up) approach starts with dimensional models for specific business processes, then integrates using conformed dimensions. Focus on delivering quick wins through iterative data mart development. Uses star schemas, prioritizes query performance and business user accessibility. Best for: agile delivery, business-focused analytics.

### 8. What is the Inmon methodology?
Inmon (top-down) approach builds a normalized enterprise data warehouse first, then creates data marts from it. Emphasizes data integration and creating single source of truth. Uses 3NF for warehouse, dimensional models for marts. Best for: enterprise-wide consistency, long-term scalability, comprehensive data integration.

### 9. What is the difference between Kimball and Inmon approaches?
- **Kimball:** Bottom-up, dimensional modeling, denormalized, faster delivery, business-process oriented, star schemas
- **Inmon:** Top-down, ER modeling, normalized warehouse, longer implementation, data-oriented, 3NF to dimensional
Kimball prioritizes speed and usability; Inmon prioritizes integration and long-term structure.

### 10. What is a staging area in data warehousing?
A staging area is a temporary storage location where raw extracted data lands before transformation and loading into the warehouse. Purpose: isolate source systems from warehouse processes, enable data quality checks, support restart/recovery, perform initial transformations. Usually not accessed by end users and data may be truncated after successful load.

### 11. What is an operational data store (ODS)?
An ODS is an integrated database containing current, detailed operational data from multiple sources, updated in near real-time. Serves as intermediate layer between OLTP systems and data warehouse. Use cases: operational reporting, data quality hub, real-time tactical decisions. More current than warehouse but less historical; normalized or lightly dimensional structure.

## Data Vault Modeling

### 1. What is Data Vault modeling?
Data Vault is a modeling methodology designed for enterprise data warehouses, emphasizing agility, scalability, and auditability. Combines normalized structure with historical tracking, using three core components: Hubs (business keys), Links (relationships), and Satellites (attributes/history). Developed by Dan Linstedt, optimized for handling changes in source systems and business requirements.

### 2. What are the main components of Data Vault (Hub, Link, Satellite)?
- **Hub:** Contains unique business keys and metadata (load date, source)
- **Link:** Represents relationships between Hubs, stores foreign keys
- **Satellite:** Stores descriptive attributes and tracks historical changes (SCD Type 2 style)
All components include audit columns (load_date, record_source) for traceability.

### 3. What is a Hub in Data Vault?
A Hub represents a core business entity containing only the business key (natural key), a hash key (surrogate key), load timestamp, and record source. No descriptive attributes. Example: Customer_Hub with customer_hash_key, customer_id (business key), load_date, source_system. Immutable once created - records never deleted or updated.

### 4. What is a Link in Data Vault?
A Link represents relationships between two or more Hubs, containing hash keys from related Hubs plus its own hash key and audit columns. Captures many-to-many relationships. Example: Order_Customer_Link connects Order_Hub and Customer_Hub with order_hash_key, customer_hash_key, link_hash_key, load_date, source. Transaction records like orders are often modeled as Links.

### 5. What is a Satellite in Data Vault?
A Satellite stores descriptive attributes and their history for a Hub or Link. Contains parent hash key, load_date (part of PK for history), all descriptive attributes, and optional load_end_date. Multiple Satellites can attach to one Hub for different change rates or sources. Example: Customer_Name_Satellite tracks name changes while Customer_Address_Satellite tracks address changes separately.

### 6. What are the advantages of Data Vault modeling?
- **Audit trail:** Full lineage with load dates and sources
- **Flexibility:** Easy to add new sources or attributes without restructuring
- **Historical tracking:** Complete history through Satellites
- **Parallel loading:** Independent components enable concurrent ETL
- **Insert-only:** No updates/deletes, simplifies ETL
- **Scalability:** Handles large volumes and frequent changes
- **Traceability:** Know when, where, and how data arrived

### 7. When would you choose Data Vault over other modeling techniques?
Choose Data Vault when: (1) Multiple source systems with frequent schema changes, (2) Strict audit requirements and compliance needs, (3) Agile development with evolving requirements, (4) Large-scale enterprise warehouse, (5) Need parallel ETL processing, (6) Full historical tracking required. Avoid for: simple analytics use cases, small data volumes, quick BI delivery needed (use Kimball), stable source systems.

### 8. How does Data Vault support historical tracking?
Satellites implement SCD Type 2 automatically - each attribute change creates a new Satellite record with a new load_date while preserving previous versions. The combination of parent hash key and load_date forms the primary key, maintaining complete history. Query specific point-in-time by filtering on load_date. Links also track when relationships formed through load_date.

## Advanced Data Modeling Concepts

### 1. What is data redundancy and how do you minimize it?
Data redundancy is duplicate storage of the same data in multiple places. Causes: denormalization, poor design, lack of constraints. Minimize through: normalization (eliminate duplicates), foreign key relationships (reference instead of duplicate), conformed dimensions (shared dimensions), constraints (prevent duplicate inserts), data quality processes. Balance with performance needs in analytical systems.

### 2. What is referential integrity?
Referential integrity ensures relationships between tables remain consistent - foreign key values must exist in the referenced table's primary key, or be NULL. Enforced through foreign key constraints. Prevents orphaned records (e.g., order without customer). Can specify CASCADE, SET NULL, or RESTRICT actions on delete/update. Critical for data consistency in transactional systems.

### 3. What is a view in a database?
A view is a virtual table based on a SQL query that doesn't store data physically. Presents data from one or more tables. Benefits: simplifies complex queries, provides security (hide sensitive columns), abstracts underlying schema changes, creates user-specific perspectives. Updates to base tables reflect in views. Some views support INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations.

### 4. What is a materialized view and how does it differ from a regular view?
A materialized view physically stores query results, unlike regular views which execute the query each time. 
**Regular View:** No storage, always current data, slower for complex queries
**Materialized View:** Stores results, requires refresh (scheduled or on-demand), faster queries, uses storage, potential staleness
Use materialized views for expensive aggregations, reporting, frequently-accessed complex queries.

### 5. What is partitioning in data modeling?
Partitioning divides large tables into smaller physical segments based on column values while appearing as single logical table. Types: range (by date ranges), list (by discrete values), hash (by hash function), composite (combination). Benefits: improved query performance (partition pruning), easier maintenance (drop old partitions), parallel processing, better manageability. Common: partition fact tables by date.

### 6. What is sharding and when would you use it?
Sharding horizontally partitions data across multiple database servers, distributing rows to different physical machines. Each shard contains subset of data (e.g., customers A-M on shard1, N-Z on shard2). Use for: horizontal scalability beyond single server capacity, geographic distribution, improved performance for large datasets. Challenges: complex queries across shards, rebalancing, distributed transactions.

### 7. How do you model hierarchical data in a relational database?
Approaches:
- **Adjacency List:** Each record has parent_id pointing to parent (simple, but recursive queries expensive)
- **Path Enumeration:** Store full path as string (e.g., "/1/3/7/", easy to query ancestors)
- **Nested Sets:** Left/right values define hierarchy (complex updates, efficient queries)
- **Closure Table:** Separate table storing all ancestor-descendant pairs (flexible, requires more storage)
Choice depends on read vs. write patterns and query requirements.

### 8. How do you model time-dependent or historical data?
Strategies:
- **Effective Dating:** Add valid_from/valid_to dates to track temporal validity
- **SCD Type 2:** New record for each change with versioning
- **Temporal Tables:** Database-native support (SQL Server, PostgreSQL) auto-tracks history
- **Event Sourcing:** Store all changes as immutable events
- **Snapshot Tables:** Daily/periodic snapshots of full state
Include is_current flag for easy filtering of active records.

### 9. What is a bridge table?
A bridge table resolves complex many-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions, especially for multi-valued dimensions. Example: Account can have multiple account holders. Bridge table contains all account-holder combinations with weighting factors to prevent double-counting in aggregations. Enables proper allocation of measures across multiple dimension members.

### 10. What is a data model schema?
A schema is the structure/organization of a database, defining tables, columns, data types, relationships, constraints, and indexes. Represents logical organization of data. Types: star schema, snowflake schema, data vault. In databases, schema also refers to a namespace/container for database objects. Documents the blueprint for database implementation.

### 11. What is the difference between a database schema and a database instance?
- **Schema:** The structure/design - table definitions, relationships, constraints, data types (the blueprint). Relatively static.
- **Instance:** The actual data stored at a specific moment (the content). Changes frequently with CRUD operations.
Analogy: Schema is the house blueprint; instance is the furniture and residents.

### 12. What is metadata and why is it important?
Metadata is "data about data" - describes structure, meaning, lineage, quality, and context of data. Types: technical metadata (schemas, data types), business metadata (definitions, ownership), operational metadata (lineage, refresh times). Importance: enables data discovery, ensures proper usage, supports governance, tracks lineage, documents transformations, aids troubleshooting. Stored in data catalogs or metadata repositories.

## Data Modeling for Specific Technologies

### 1. What are the key considerations for data modeling in Snowflake?
- **Clustering keys:** For large tables to optimize query performance (not traditional indexes)
- **Time Travel:** Consider retention needs (1-90 days) for historical queries
- **Zero-copy cloning:** Design for test/dev environments
- **Semi-structured data:** Use VARIANT type for JSON/XML instead of flattening everything
- **Micro-partitions:** Automatic, but design with query patterns in mind
- **Denormalization:** Storage is cheap, compute is pay-per-use, so optimize for query efficiency
- **Separation of storage and compute:** Can scale independently

### 2. How does data modeling differ in NoSQL databases vs relational databases?

**NoSQL:** Schema-flexible, denormalized, optimize for access patterns, embed related data, no joins, eventual consistency, horizontal scaling. Design based on query needs first.
**Relational:** Schema-rigid, normalized, optimize for data integrity, separate related tables, joins, ACID transactions, vertical scaling. Design for data relationships first.
NoSQL favors read performance and scalability; SQL favors data integrity and complex queries.

### 3. What is columnar storage and how does it impact data modeling?
Columnar storage stores data by columns rather than rows. Impact on modeling: better for analytics (scan fewer columns), excellent compression (similar values grouped), slower for transactional inserts, efficient for aggregations. Design considerations: include only needed columns, denormalize to avoid joins, use appropriate data types for compression, partition by frequently filtered columns. Used in Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery.

### 4. How do you model data for a data lake?
Data lake modeling strategies:
- **Raw zone:** Store source data as-is in native format (schema-on-read)
- **Curated zone:** Apply schema, clean, standardize
- **Analytics zone:** Dimensional models, aggregated views
Use formats like Parquet/ORC for efficiency, partition by date/region, implement metadata catalog (AWS Glue, Azure Purview), consider Delta Lake/Iceberg for ACID transactions. Balance schema flexibility with governance.

### 5. What is the difference between data modeling for RDBMS and cloud data warehouses?

**RDBMS:** Focus on normalization, careful indexing, limited storage considerations, vertical scaling constraints
**Cloud Warehouses:** Embrace denormalization, fewer indexes (clustering instead), storage is cheap (prioritize compute efficiency), elastic scaling, columnar storage, automatic optimization, separation of storage/compute
Cloud warehouses favor simplicity and query performance over storage optimization.

### 6. How do you approach data modeling in Amazon Redshift?
Redshift-specific considerations:
- **Distribution keys:** Choose to minimize data movement (EVEN, KEY, ALL distribution styles)
- **Sort keys:** Define for frequently filtered columns (compound or interleaved)
- **Compression:** Let Redshift auto-compress or specify encodings
- **Denormalization:** Favor to reduce joins
- **Columnar storage:** Only include necessary columns
- **Small dimension tables:** Use ALL distribution
- **Large fact tables:** Use distribution key matching frequent join columns

### 7. What are distribution keys and sort keys in Redshift?

**Distribution Key:** Determines how data spreads across compute nodes. Strategies: KEY (by column value - use for large tables on join columns), ALL (replicate to all nodes - use for small dimensions), EVEN (round-robin - use when no clear key). Goal: minimize data movement during joins.
**Sort Key:** Determines physical storage order. Types: Compound (multiple columns in order), Interleaved (equal weight to columns). Use for frequently filtered/joined columns, date ranges. Improves query performance through zone maps.

(Example response framework)
**Problem:** Needed to track product pricing with multiple complexity factors: time-based changes, customer-specific pricing, volume discounts, regional variations, and promotional pricing - all simultaneously.
**Challenge:** Standard SCD Type 2 couldn't handle multiple overlapping price factors.
**Solution:** Created a multi-dimensional pricing model:
- Base price in Product dimension (SCD Type 2)
- PriceRule table with rule_type, priority, effective dates
- CustomerPriceOverride for custom pricing
- PromotionalPrice for temporary discounts
- PriceCalculation fact table logging actual prices applied
Applied rule hierarchy during calculation: promotional > customer-specific > volume > base.
**Outcome:** Flexible pricing while maintaining audit trail and enabling pricing analytics.

### 11. Describe a situation where you refactored an existing data model?
(Example framework)
**Situation:** Inherited normalized OLTP model used for reporting with 15+ table joins causing timeout issues.
**Problem:** Reports took 5+ minutes; users frustrated.
**Analysis:** Profiled queries - 80% accessed same 5 core entities with same join patterns.
**Solution:** 
- Created denormalized reporting layer (star schema)
- Built nightly ETL from normalized source
- Implemented aggregate tables for common metrics
- Kept normalized model for transactional processing
**Result:** Report queries improved from 5 minutes to under 10 seconds. Maintained data integrity in source while optimizing for analytics.

### 12. How have you used data modeling to solve a business problem?
(Example framework)
**Problem:** Business couldn't track customer lifetime value or identify high-value segments.
**Solution:** Designed customer analytics data mart:
- Customer dimension with demographic attributes and segmentation flags
- Transaction fact table with monetary values
- Date dimension for time-series analysis
- Product dimension for category-level analysis
- Pre-calculated Customer_Metrics table with LTV, recency, frequency, monetary value
**Implementation:** Star schema with daily refresh
**Impact:** Marketing could identify top 20% customers contributing 80% revenue, personalize campaigns, reducing churn by 15%.

### 13. Provide an example of how you optimized a data model for performance?
(Example framework)
**Scenario:** Sales fact table with 500M rows; dashboard queries scanning full table taking 2+ minutes.
**Analysis:** Most queries filtered by date and region.
**Optimizations:**
1. **Partitioned** fact table by month
2. Added **clustering key** on date and region
3. **Denormalized** frequently-joined dimension attributes into fact
4. Created **aggregate tables** for monthly/yearly summaries
5. Implemented **materialized views** for common report queries
6. Archived data older than 3 years to separate table
**Result:** Query time reduced from 2 minutes to 5 seconds. Storage increased 15% but performance gain worth the trade-off.

### 14. Describe your process for migrating data models from one database system to another?

4. **Data type conversion:** Map compatible types, handle incompatibilities
5. **Proof of concept:** Migrate sample subset
6. **ETL development:** Build extraction and transformation pipelines
7. **Incremental migration:** Move by priority/module
8. **Validation:** Compare row counts, checksums, critical queries
9. **Performance tuning:** Optimize for target platform
10. **Parallel run:** Operate both systems briefly to ensure accuracy
11. **Cutover:** Switch production traffic
Document all transformations and platform-specific optimizations.

## SQL and Query-Related Questions

### 1. How do you write efficient queries against normalized vs denormalized data?

**Normalized:** 
- Use proper JOIN syntax with appropriate join types
- Filter early with WHERE clauses to reduce dataset
- Join on indexed columns (primary/foreign keys)
- Consider query execution plans to identify bottlenecks
- May require multiple joins for related data

**Denormalized:**
- Simpler queries with fewer/no joins
- Direct column access for aggregations
- More efficient for read-heavy workloads
- Potential for scanning redundant data
- Use WHERE filters on commonly queried columns

General: Analyze execution plans, use appropriate indexes, limit result sets, avoid SELECT *.

### 2. What indexes would you create to optimize query performance?
Index creation strategies:
- **Primary key indexes:** Automatic, ensure uniqueness
- **Foreign key indexes:** Speed up joins between related tables
- **Filter columns:** Columns frequently in WHERE clauses
- **Join columns:** Non-PK columns used in joins
- **Sort columns:** Columns in ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- **Composite indexes:** Multiple columns queried together (order matters)
- **Covering indexes:** Include all columns needed by query
- **Partial indexes:** Index subset of rows meeting criteria

Caution: Too many indexes slow writes. Monitor query patterns and index usage statistics.

### 3. How do you handle NULL values in your data model?
Strategies:
- **Avoid NULLs:** Use default values where appropriate (0, empty string, default date)
- **NOT NULL constraints:** Enforce for required fields
- **Separate indicator columns:** Use is_deleted, is_active flags instead of NULL
- **Three-valued logic awareness:** NULL in comparisons returns UNKNOWN (not TRUE/FALSE)
- **Aggregate handling:** COUNT(*) vs COUNT(column) - latter excludes NULLs
- **Indexing:** Many databases don't index NULL values
- **COALESCE/ISNULL:** Provide defaults in queries
- **Outer joins:** Understand NULL introduction in results

Document NULL semantics: does NULL mean "unknown", "not applicable", or "missing"?

### 4. What are constraints and what types are commonly used?
Constraints enforce data integrity rules:
- **PRIMARY KEY:** Uniquely identifies rows, implies NOT NULL and UNIQUE
- **FOREIGN KEY:** Maintains referential integrity between tables
- **UNIQUE:** Ensures no duplicate values (allows one NULL)
- **NOT NULL:** Requires value, prevents NULL
- **CHECK:** Validates data against condition (e.g., age > 0, status IN ('active','inactive'))
- **DEFAULT:** Provides value when none specified

Benefits: Prevent invalid data at database level, self-documenting rules, consistent enforcement across applications.

### 5. What is the difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE, and DROP?
- **DELETE:** Removes rows based on WHERE condition, logs each deletion, can rollback, triggers fire, slower. Syntax: `DELETE FROM table WHERE condition`
- **TRUNCATE:** Removes all rows quickly, minimal logging, can't rollback (in most DBs), doesn't fire triggers, resets identity columns, faster. Syntax: `TRUNCATE TABLE table`
- **DROP:** Removes entire table structure and data, can't rollback, frees storage. Syntax: `DROP TABLE table`

Use DELETE for selective removal, TRUNCATE for clearing tables, DROP for removing tables entirely.

### 6. How do you implement data integrity in your models?
Multi-layered approach:
**Database level:**
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Unique and check constraints
- NOT NULL constraints
- Default values
- Triggers for complex business rules

**Application level:**
- Validation before database operations
- Transaction management (ACID properties)
- Error handling and rollback logic

**Process level:**
- Data quality checks in ETL pipelines
- Automated testing of transformations
- Regular data profiling and anomaly detection
- Master data management
- Data stewardship and ownership

**Documentation:**
- Clear business rules
- Data dictionaries
- Validation rule specifications

Combine database constraints (first line of defense) with application validation and monitoring.
